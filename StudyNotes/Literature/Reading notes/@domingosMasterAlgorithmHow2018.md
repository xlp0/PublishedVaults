On page 25, it stated the central hypothesis of this book:

> All knowledge—past, present, and future—can be derived from data by a single, universal learning algorithm.

On page 54, the diagram showed how Domingos tried to synthesize all five tribes of approaches into a single algorithm:

On Page 240, Domingos stated his thesis using a single diagram again, this time, a Concentric Circle of all five tribes with the Master Equation in the center.

This diagram denotes that the [[@domingosMasterAlgorithmHow2018|Master Equation]] is wrapped around by three layers of computational tools, namely: Representation, Evaluation, and Optimization, which can be related to the notion of [[Query, Key, and Value]]([[Query, Key, and Value|QKV]]) vectors in [[Attention|attention]] assessments, and the three types of data objects in [[Lambda Calculus]].
