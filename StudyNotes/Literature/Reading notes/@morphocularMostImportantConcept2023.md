## Why is compactness important?
It is important because it provides a rigorous definition of how [[Connection|connectedness]] can be formulated, represented, and studied. It can be a property or a measure of how to assess the qualities of a broader sets of concepts, such as the integrity and consistency of a sporadic set of ideas or data points. Once the idea of [[Compactness]] is defined, other properties can be reasoned about with [[Soundness|soundness]]. hopefully we may derive [[Precision|precise]] and [[Termination|terminable]] arguments from there.
