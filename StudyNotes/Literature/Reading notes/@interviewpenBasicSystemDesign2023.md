This video is an excellent example to show how system architecture is intimately tied to space(driver and rider locations, maps, and Uber's [[H3]] algorithm), time (real time location updates), and density of user requests. It also covers the design details of using third party payment systems, which relates to payments and utilizes external data sources such as [[Mapbox]]. This video also demonstrated how a complex system could be broken down to smaller pieces, yet enable a significant amount of functionality in a concise presentation that exemplifies the physical and social meaning of data.
