# First Paragraph
> For several centuries, the double entry system has been the bookkeeping system used by most sizable business enterprises throughout the world. It is little known in mathematics and it is virtually unknown in accounting that the double entry system is based on a well-known mathematical construction of undergraduate algebra, the group of differences, in which the integers are represented as equivalent classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers.

# Mentioning Hamilton
On page 227 of this paper, he said:
> As an abstract mathematical construction, the group of differences seems to have been first pbusliehd by Sir [[William Hamilton|William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1937 [[@hamiltonTHEORYCONJUGATEFUNCTIONS|(see conjugate functions below)]]. Hamilton presented the ordered-pairs construction of the integers as a prelude to his ordered-pairs treatment of the complex numbers. He made no mention of bookkeeping although accountants had, at that time, been using the intuitive algebra of the ordered pairs called "[[T-accounts]]" for about four centries.
