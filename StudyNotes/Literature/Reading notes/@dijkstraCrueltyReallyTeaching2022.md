This article is an ideal source to reason about what is [[Computational Thinking]]? Moreover, it is the best paper in pondering about the [[Physical Meaning of Data|physical]] and [[Social Meaning of Data|social meaning]] of data. This is the paper that mentioned: [[Formal Methods Initiative]]([[Formal Methods Initiative|FMI]]). He also mentioned the [[Mathematical Guild]]. He also used the term:[[Radical Novelty]] many times. See [the wiki page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/On_the_Cruelty_of_Really_Teaching_Computer_Science) for the more detailed information on this 1988 hand-written paper.

## About Educatoin
On p.19 of this paper, [[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra|Dijkstra]] said: 
> The problem with educational policy is that it is hardly influenced by scientific considerations derived from the topics taught and almost entirely determined by extra-scientific circumstances such as the combined expectations of the students, their parents, and their future employers, and the prevailing view on the role of the university: is the stress on training its graduates for today's entry-level jobs or on providing its alumni with the intellectual baggage and attitudes that will last them another 50 years?

## About Proofing Correctness
The following statement partially explains why Dijkstra writes his papers in hand written form. This shows that he is a quintessential mathematician.

On p.27, he started saying:
> Right from the beginning, and all through the course, we stress that the programmer's task is not just to write down a program, but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification. While designing proofs and programs hand in hand, the student gets ample opportunity to prefect his manipulative agility with the [[Predicate Calculus|predicate calculus]]. Finally, in order to drive home the message that this introductory programming course is primarily a course in formal mathematics, we see to it that the programming language in question has not been implemented on campus so that students are protected from the temptation to test their programs. And this concludes the sketch of my proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen.
