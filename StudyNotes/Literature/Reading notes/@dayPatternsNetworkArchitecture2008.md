"Patterns in network architecture: a return to fundamentals" is a book written by [[John Day]]. The book explores the fundamental principles behind network architecture and aims to provide a fresh perspective on the topic.

John Day is an influential computer scientist and researcher who has made significant contributions to the field of computer networking. He has worked at various institutions including Bell Labs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Boston University. Day has been involved in the development of several important networking protocols and technologies.

In his book, "Patterns in network architecture: a return to fundamentals," Day argues that many modern network architectures have become overly complex and difficult to manage. He proposes that by returning to fundamental principles, it is possible to simplify network design and improve overall efficiency.

The book delves into various patterns and principles that can be applied to network architecture, drawing on examples from both historical and contemporary networks. It covers topics such as modularity, layering, naming, addressing, routing, and security. Day provides insights into how these patterns can be used to create more robust and scalable networks.

"Patterns in network architecture: a return to fundamentals" offers a comprehensive analysis of network design principles while providing practical guidance for engineers, researchers, and designers in the field of computer networking. It challenges existing approaches to network architecture and encourages readers to think critically about their designs.

Overall, the book serves as an important resource for those interested in understanding the underlying principles that shape modern computer networks. It presents valuable insights from John Day's extensive experience in the field and offers a thought-provoking perspective on network architecture.
