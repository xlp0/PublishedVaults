[[Meta knowledge]], also known as metacognition, refers to the awareness and understanding of one's own cognitive processes and the ability to regulate and control these processes. It involves knowledge about how we think, learn, remember, and solve problems.

In cognitive science, meta knowledge is often studied to understand how individuals monitor and regulate their own thinking and learning strategies. It includes knowledge about one's own strengths and weaknesses in different cognitive tasks, the ability to set goals and plan strategies to achieve those goals, monitor progress towards the goals, evaluate the effectiveness of strategies used, and make adjustments when necessary.

Meta knowledge plays a crucial role in various aspects of cognition such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, memory retrieval, and self-regulation. It allows individuals to reflect on their thought processes, monitor their comprehension or understanding of information, identify gaps in knowledge or understanding, and take appropriate actions to improve their learning or performance.

Overall, meta knowledge is an important aspect of cognitive science as it provides insights into how individuals engage in self-regulated learning and thinking processes. Understanding how people are aware of and control their own cognitive abilities can have implications for educational practices, training programs, therapeutic interventions, and overall enhancement of cognitive functioning.
