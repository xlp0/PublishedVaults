It should be noted that on the back of the 1997 version of the book it says:
> "The Individual will become more of an entrepreneur, a private contractor, in complete control of his or her finances, with easy access to enormous computing power - in fact the Sovereign Individual. "


"The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age" is a non-fiction book written by [[James Dale Davidson]] and [[William Rees-Mogg]], originally published in 1997. The book explores the impact of the emerging digital revolution on society, economics, and politics.

The central thesis of "[[@davidsonSovereignIndividualMastering1999|The Sovereign Individual]]" is that with the rise of the information age, individuals will gain unprecedented power and autonomy. The authors argue that technological advancements, particularly in communication and cryptography, will lead to a shift in power from traditional institutions to individuals. They predict that this shift will result in a new social structure where nation-states lose their significance as people become increasingly sovereign.

Davidson and Rees-Mogg argue that with increased access to information and technology, individuals will be able to transcend geographical boundaries and form new communities based on shared interests rather than [[National Identity|national identity]]. They believe that this will lead to a decline in centralized authority and a rise in decentralized governance structures.

Moreover, the authors predict significant changes in economic systems. They suggest that traditional employment models will become obsolete as individuals gain more control over their work through digital platforms and entrepreneurship. They also discuss how wealth creation will be reshaped, with investment strategies becoming more individualized and decentralized.

"[[@davidsonSovereignIndividualMastering1999|The Sovereign Individual]]" also delves into political implications. The authors argue that nation-states will struggle to adapt to these changes, leading to potential conflicts between established powers and newly empowered individuals. They explore scenarios where governments become more authoritarian or attempt to regulate emerging technologies but ultimately conclude that individual sovereignty will prevail.

Critics of the book argue that some predictions made by Davidson and Rees-Mogg have not fully materialized or have been overly optimistic. However, "[[@davidsonSovereignIndividualMastering1999|The Sovereign Individual]]" remains influential for its thought-provoking analysis of how technological advancements might reshape society, economy, and politics in the information age.
