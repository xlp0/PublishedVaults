# Comments
While watching this video, I realized that [[CICD]] is a macro-scopic [[REPL]]. [[CICD]] is driven by passing tests. That means one should design a way to trigger and monitor test results at all stages. The use automated tasks, such as tasks scheduled by [[cron]] jobs, or human guarded events, guarded by [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]], should be formalized in a singular data package. It requires many stages of judgements to ensure the integrated and deployed assets are [[Correctness|correct]]. This means that an [[XLP]]-based "Integrated Curriculum" should include this [[CICD]] from the get go.
