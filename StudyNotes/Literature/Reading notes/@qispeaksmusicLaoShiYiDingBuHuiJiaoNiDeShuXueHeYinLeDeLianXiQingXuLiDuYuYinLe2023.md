[[Qi Wang]] is a Youtuber, who also teaches math and piano in a university, likely in Hongkong. This video provided a significant amount of hints to do integration between EuMuse and XLP. Starting out, he showed that by classifying musical tempo, dynamics, articulation, and [[Musical Terminologies|many other terms]], will not only expand the vocabulary of learners but also provides an abstract space for classifying the ways to express cognitive experiences. This is a way to assign the same name to different musical expressions, an idea that is very much relevant to [[Henry Poincare|Henry Poincaré's]] notion of mathematics. 


### Sigma Algebra
[[σ-algebra]] ([[σ-algebra|Sigma 代数]])： 


Then, he mentioned [[σ-algebra|Sigma Algebra]], this link makes the expression of cognitive experiences measurable. Sigma algebra is strongly associated with [[Measurement Theory]] and [[Probability Theory]]. Associating Sigma algebra with musical expressions makes the classification and measurements of these cognitive experiences computable. This is directly relevant to how [[PKC]]
could be used to collect data on how music listeners and performers relate their cognitive experience with music in a measurable and consistent manner.

### [[Filtration]] ([[Filtration|域流]])

Starting at [8:16](https://youtu.be/UGg6Z8LeJpY?t=496) , he presented [[Filtration|filtration]] ([[Filtration|域流]]) as a mathematical term for information content increases as time moves on. He later also mentioned the idea of information granularity, he explained that different performers or listeners would have different capabilities to classify the cognitive experience in finer or coarser granularities. This is clearly related to whether one has the right vocabulary to encode and describe their experience. On the other hand, by counting the words that are utilized in a [[PKC]], one could assess the vocabulary used by a person, therefore assess one's cognitive skills in classifying and incremental evolution of the ability to filter information content.

By listening to him, I realized that he must be aware of the following book: [[@mazzolaToposMusicGeometric2002|The Topos of Music]].  [[GASing]] should invite him to help design the [[EuMuse]] curriculum.


### How is Meta Knowledge useful

He claimed that what he teaches is [[Meta knowledge|meta knowledge]]. Meaning that this knowledge will not be directly applicable to play piano better, it will also not be directly useful in doing or solving a particular mathematical problem faster. However, it provides the links and the overarching maps of the content of many fields of knowledge. This is what we can emphasize the demonstrate using tools such as [[PKC]] and [[Obsidian]]. The main revelation is that we can explicitly work with [[Meta knowledge]], so that we can create and optimize the architecture of knowledge acquisition in a more consistent and rigorous manner, especially integrating this study of [[Meta knowledge]] in the context of learning tools and knowledge processing instruments such as search engines and [[Large Language Model|large language models]].

### Concrete Vocabulary/Marker for Abstract Content
The key insight is that by associating cognitive experience with precise mathematical terms, we will have a way to relate human actions and time-based emotional activities to a set of formal tags, so that it will help us perform precise accounting of these phenomena, therefore, organize a way to better understand the relationships between actions and reactions of musical content. It could be generally applied to all kinds of time-based media, including long-term individual and group behavior. Moreover, we can apply computational methods to measure the causal relations between content consumption, therefore create a model to better compensate these viewers.
