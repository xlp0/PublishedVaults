## Message sent to the [[Monday Seminar]]

I was extremely impressed by this movie and thought it would be useful to share it with you because it touches on many of the topics we discussed in our seminar. 

This video discusses [[Subtraction]] as "[[Arrow|the Arrow]]", and it uses arrow as an anti-symmetric symbol to demonstrate how symmetry is an important consideration in designing linguistic symbolism. This video also showed the connection of the [[Subtraction]] operator to many fields, including [[Mathematical Logic]], [[Linear Algebra]], [[Geometry]] and [[Category Theory]].

# Why use an Arrow to denote Subtraction
[Starting at 7'40"](https://youtu.be/PIo6C2U1GEY?t=460) of the video by [[All Angles]], it argues for using an anti-symmetric symbol to denote operations such as [[Subtraction]]. This is a crucial idea in language design, and supports the ideas of presenting [[Quantum Mechanics]] to children as stated in the book: [[@coeckePicturingQuantumProcesses2017|Picturing Quantum Processes]]. More importantly, it is compatible to the argument of why [[Product and Coproduct|Product]] and [[Product and Coproduct|Coproduct]] are representable by a pair of arrows.
