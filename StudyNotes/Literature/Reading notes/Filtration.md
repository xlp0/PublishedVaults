In mathematics, [filtration](app://obsidian.md/filtration) ([[Filtration|域流]]) refers to a sequence of nested subspaces or subsets of a given set, typically ordered by inclusion. It is often used in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.

In algebraic topology, a filtration is commonly used to study the properties and behavior of topological spaces over different scales. For example, in the context of homology theory, a filtration can be applied to a chain complex to study its successive approximations. This allows for the computation of homology groups at different levels of detail.

In algebraic geometry, a filtration can be used to understand the geometry of an algebraic variety by looking at its subvarieties or subsets in a systematic way. By considering an increasing sequence of subvarieties or subsets, one can gain insights into the structure and properties of the original variety.

Overall, filtration provides a way to organize mathematical objects into a hierarchy or progression that captures their intrinsic properties and relationships. It allows for analysis at different levels or stages, leading to deeper understanding and meaningful computations.
