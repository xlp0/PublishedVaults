"Art & Physics: Parallel Visions in Space, Time, and Light" is a book written by Leonard Shlain and published in 1991. The book explores the relationship between art and physics throughout history, suggesting that both fields have influenced and inspired each other.

In "Art & Physics," Shlain delves into the idea that artistic advancements often precede scientific discoveries, challenging the traditional belief that art is merely a reflection of scientific knowledge. He argues that artists have an inherent ability to tap into intuitive realms of understanding that can lead to scientific breakthroughs.

The book covers various periods in history, from the Renaissance to modern times, highlighting how certain artistic movements and concepts parallel significant developments in physics. Shlain focuses on five main themes: symmetry, space-time, light, color, and form. He examines how these concepts are explored in both art and physics and how they have evolved over time.

Shlain also explores the ways in which art has often foreshadowed scientific theories. For example, he discusses how artists like Leonardo da Vinci anticipated concepts such as fractals and the theory of relativity through their artwork. By examining these connections between art and physics, Shlain aims to demonstrate the interconnectedness of human creativity and intellectual exploration.

"Art & Physics" received positive reviews for its unique perspective on the relationship between art and science. It was praised for its accessible writing style that makes complex scientific concepts understandable for non-experts. However, some critics argued that Shlain's claims were too speculative or lacked sufficient evidence.

Overall, "Art & Physics" offers a thought-provoking exploration of the intersections between art and science throughout history. It presents an alternative perspective on how creativity and inspiration can shape our understanding of the world around us.
