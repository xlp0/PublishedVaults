# Preface
> The Principles of Book-keeping by Double Entry constitute a theory which is mathematically by no means uninteresting : it is in fact like Euclid's theory of ratios an absolutely perfect one, and it is only its extreme simplicity which presents it from being as interesting as it would otherwise be. But without entering into the question from this point of view, I remark only that I have endeavoured to exhibit the Principles in a thoroughly practical form, and by a simple example to show how they are in fact applicable to any kind of business transaction.
