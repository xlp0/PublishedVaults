[[Mathematica]] is a powerful software program used for mathematical and scientific computations, data analysis, visualization, and programming. It was developed by Stephen Wolfram and his team at Wolfram Research. Mathematica provides a comprehensive environment for technical computing and has been widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, finance, biology, and computer science.

[[Stephen Wolfram]] is a British-American computer scientist, physicist, and entrepreneur. He was born on August 29, 1959, in London. Wolfram has made significant contributions to the fields of cellular automata theory, computational physics, artificial intelligence, and computer algebra systems.

Wolfram attended Eton College and later studied at the University of Oxford. At the age of 20, he received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His early work focused on particle physics and quantum field theory.

In 1987, Wolfram founded Wolfram Research to develop Mathematica—a groundbreaking software that aimed to provide an integrated computational system capable of solving complex problems across different domains. The first version of Mathematica was released in 1988.

Wolfram's vision extended beyond just creating a software program. He aimed to build a knowledge-based system that could understand and computationally represent vast amounts of information from various fields. This led him to develop Wolfram Alpha—a computational knowledge engine that provides answers to factual queries using its vast knowledge base.

[[Theodore Gray]] is an American chemist, author, and co-founder of Wolfram Research. Born on November 25th, 1962 in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, Gray has a strong passion for science education and communication.

Gray joined forces with Stephen Wolfram to co-create Mathematica in the late 1980s. He played a crucial role in designing the user interface for Mathematica as well as developing its core functionality related to chemistry and materials science.

In addition to his work on Mathematica, Gray is well-known for his book "The Elements," which showcases the beauty and diversity of the periodic table. The book became a bestseller and received widespread acclaim for its stunning photography and engaging descriptions of each element.

Together, Stephen Wolfram and Theodore Gray have made significant contributions to the field of computational science through their work on Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, and their efforts in science education and outreach.
