[[Mathematica Notebook]] is a software application used for computations, data analysis, and visualization. It is a part of Mathematica, a comprehensive technical computing system developed by Wolfram Research. Mathematica Notebook allows users to input and execute mathematical formulas, create interactive documents, and collaborate on projects. The design and implementation of [[Mathematica Notebook]] predates [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s [[World Wide Web]] Browser, and is considered to be the origin of the Web Browser, see [[@ScientificPaperObsolete|The Scientific Paper is Obsolete]].

Theodore Gray is an American chemist, author, and software developer who co-founded Wolfram Research with [[Stephen Wolfram]] in 1987. He played a crucial role in the development of Mathematica and has made significant contributions to its user interface design. Gray's expertise in chemistry has also influenced the inclusion of chemical computation capabilities in Mathematica.

Apart from his contributions to software development, Gray is known for his work in popular science communication. He has authored several books on chemistry and science education, including "The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe," which became a bestseller. In addition to his writing career, he has created educational apps and interactive content related to science.

Gray's passion for scientific education led him to create stunning visualizations that showcase the beauty and complexity of the chemical elements. His work combines art with science to engage people of all ages in learning about chemistry.

Overall, Theodore Gray's contributions to the development of Mathematica and his efforts in promoting scientific education through captivating visualizations have made him an influential figure in both the fields of computational software and popular science communication.
