Direct-attached storage (DAS) is a digital storage system that connects directly to a computer, workstation, or server[a1](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[a2](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html). It is not attached to a network, meaning that the storage can only be accessed by the device that it is connected to[a3](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[1](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html). DAS can be internal or external [a4](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[1](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html).

Here are some key features of DAS:

- **Storage Units**: DAS consists of one or more storage units such as hard drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives within an external enclosure[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage).
- **Connection**: The main protocols used for DAS connections are ATA, SATA, eSATA, NVMe, SCSI, SAS, USB, USB 3.0 and IEEE 1394 [b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage).
- **Performance**: DAS is typically considered much faster than network-attached storage (NAS) due to lower latency in the type of host connection [c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage).
- **Applications**: DAS is used when high performance and large amounts of storage capacity are needed. It’s a practical storage choice for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that need simple storage systems and don’t need to share data across the organization[1](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html).
## Example
The [[BeeDrive]] from Synology is a typyical [[DAS]] product.

# Conclusion
In summary, DAS is a type of digital storage that is directly attached to the computer accessing it[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)[3](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[4](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/direct-attached-storage/). It’s typically used for internal storage in personal computers and servers in the form of a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD) directly connected to the motherboard[5](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[6](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html). External storage such as USB devices and external hard drives are also considered to be direct-attached storage devices[7](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html)[8](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-attached-storage.html).
