A [[Smart Contract|smart contract]] is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It is built on top of a blockchain platform, typically using decentralized ledger technology like [[Ethereum]]. Smart contracts automatically execute and enforce the agreed-upon terms without requiring intermediaries or third-party involvement.

In a blockchain context, smart contracts serve as the backbone of decentralized applications ([[Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/dApp|DApps]]). They enable [[Trustless]] and transparent interactions between multiple parties by eliminating the need for intermediaries to oversee and enforce agreements. Smart contracts are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and security.

The key features of smart contracts in blockchain are:

1. Automation: Smart contracts eliminate the need for manual execution by automating agreement enforcement based on predefined conditions coded into the contract.

2. Trust: Blockchain's decentralized nature ensures that all parties involved can trust the execution and outcome of a smart contract. Transactions recorded on the blockchain cannot be altered or tampered with, providing a high level of transparency.

3. Decentralization: Smart contracts operate within a decentralized network of computers (nodes) that collectively validate and execute transactions. This eliminates single points of failure and ensures that no single entity has control over the contract's execution.

4. Accuracy: By eliminating human error in executing traditional contracts, smart contracts reduce mistakes caused by misinterpretation or negligence.

5. Cost-efficiency: Since smart contracts eliminate intermediaries such as lawyers or brokers, transaction costs associated with traditional contract enforcement are significantly reduced.

6. Time savings: Smart contracts streamline the process by automating tasks that typically require manual intervention, accelerating transaction times compared to traditional methods.

7. Flexibility: Smart contracts can be programmed to handle complex scenarios with conditional statements, allowing for dynamic agreements that adjust based on changing circumstances.

8. Scalability: As smart contracts operate within a blockchain network, they benefit from inherent scalability features provided by distributed ledger technology.

Overall, smart contracts in blockchain enable secure, automated, and tamper-proof execution of agreements, revolutionizing various industries by transforming how transactions and agreements are conducted.
