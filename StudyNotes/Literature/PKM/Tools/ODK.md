[Open Data Kit](https://getodk.org/) (ODK) is a free and open-source set of tools that allows users to build and collect data using mobile devices. It was originally developed by researchers at the University of Washington's Department of Computer Science and Engineering in 2008.

ODK is designed to enable data collection in challenging environments where internet connectivity may be limited or unreliable. It provides a platform for creating mobile forms, collecting data, managing the collected data, and analyzing it. The toolkit consists of four main components:

1. ODK Build: A web-based form designer that allows users to create customized forms using a drag-and-drop interface without any programming knowledge.

2. ODK Collect: An Android app that can be installed on smartphones or tablets to collect data offline. It supports various question types, such as text, numeric, multiple-choice, multimedia, GPS coordinates, etc.

3. ODK Aggregate: A server application that stores and manages collected data. It enables users to upload collected data from ODK Collect onto a server for secure storage and analysis.

4. ODK Briefcase: A desktop application that allows users to pull data from ODK Aggregate onto their computer for easy offline access and analysis.

ODK also supports integration with other tools and platforms like Google Sheets, Excel, KoboToolbox, and more. It provides flexibility in designing forms and collecting diverse types of data efficiently.

ODK has been widely adopted by researchers, non-profit organizations, governments, and companies globally for various purposes such as surveys, monitoring programs, health interventions, humanitarian aid efforts, environmental studies, etc.

## Related Data Collection Framework
One can think of [[ODK]] being a tool to be used in the collection process of [[OSINT|Open Source Intelligence]]([[OSINT]]). The two terms, [[ODK]] and [[OSINT]] are not directly related, but can be integrated in conjuction.

# Conclusion
Overall, Open Data Kit simplifies the process of mobile-based data collection in resource-constrained settings while ensuring flexibility and openness in managing collected information.
