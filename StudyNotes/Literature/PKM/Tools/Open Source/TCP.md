[[TCP]] stands for [[TCP|Transmission Control Protocol]]. It is one of the main protocols in the [[TCP/IP]] suite, which is a set of communication protocols used for connecting devices on the internet. TCP provides reliable and ordered delivery of data between two endpoints in a network. It ensures that data packets are properly transmitted, received, and reassembled at the destination, and it handles congestion control and flow control to maintain optimal performance. TCP is responsible for establishing and terminating connections between devices, as well as managing error detection and correction.
