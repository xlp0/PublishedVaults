The [[Geometry Nodes]] in [[Blender]] refers to a powerful procedural modeling feature introduced in Blender 2.93 (and later versions). It allows users to create and manipulate 3D geometry using a node-based workflow, offering a non-destructive and flexible approach to modeling.

Key Features and Capabilities of Geometry Nodes:

1. Node-Based Workflow: Geometry Nodes provide a visual node editor where users can connect nodes to define the geometry and manipulate it procedurally. This allows for a more flexible and intuitive way to create complex 3D shapes and structures.

2. Procedural Modeling: With Geometry Nodes, users can create procedural geometry that adapts and responds to changes in parameters. It is particularly useful for generating repetitive patterns, fractals, and complex structures that would be challenging to model manually.

3. Mesh Generation and Manipulation: Geometry Nodes can generate primitive shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres, cylinders) and manipulate them using various operations, such as transformations, deformations, and boolean operations.

4. Instancing: Instancing allows users to duplicate and distribute geometry across a surface or along a curve. This feature is useful for creating arrays, particle systems, and foliage, among other things.

5. Attribute Handling: Geometry Nodes allow users to create and manipulate attributes associated with geometry, such as vertex colors, UVs, normals, and custom attributes. This provides greater control over the appearance and behavior of the 3D model.

6. Interactivity: Geometry Nodes can be interactively adjusted and modified, making it easy to experiment with different designs and variations without affecting the base mesh. The changes can be updated in real-time, providing instant feedback.

7. Animation: Geometry Nodes can be animated over time, allowing for dynamic and procedural animations that respond to changing conditions or parameters.

8. Data Flow and Looping: Geometry Nodes support data flow and looping structures, enabling users to create more complex procedural setups and repetitive patterns.

Geometry Nodes offer a powerful toolset for both experienced 3D artists and newcomers to procedural modeling. They enhance Blender's capabilities for creating complex geometry and visual effects, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of projects, from motion graphics to architectural visualization and beyond.

Please note that Blender's development is ongoing, and new features may have been introduced beyond my knowledge cutoff date. I recommend checking the official Blender documentation or release notes for the most up-to-date information on Geometry Nodes and other features.
