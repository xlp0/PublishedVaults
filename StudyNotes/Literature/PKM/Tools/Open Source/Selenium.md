[[Selenium]] and [[Playwright]] are both popular automation frameworks used for testing web applications. However, there are some key differences between the two.

1. Language Support: Selenium supports multiple programming languages including Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript, while Playwright primarily focuses on JavaScript and TypeScript.

2. Browser Support: Selenium supports a wide range of browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. Playwright also supports these browsers but provides more advanced features for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

3. Execution Speed: Playwright is known for its faster execution speed compared to Selenium. It achieves this by utilizing a single browser instance for multiple pages, thus reducing the overhead of launching multiple browser instances.

4. Cross-Browser Consistency: Selenium struggles with maintaining consistency across different browsers due to variations in browser behavior. Playwright addresses this issue by providing consistent APIs and handling browser-specific quirks transparently.

5. Debugging Capabilities: Selenium offers detailed debugging capabilities through its WebDriver interface, allowing developers to inspect elements and step through code execution. Playwright also provides similar debugging features but with enhanced capabilities like taking screenshots or videos during test execution.

6. Ecosystem and Community: Selenium has been around for a longer time and has a larger user base with extensive community support. It has a vast ecosystem of plugins, frameworks, and integrations available. On the other hand, Playwright is relatively new but gaining popularity quickly due to its powerful features.

7. Mobile Testing: Selenium has good mobile testing capabilities using tools like Appium for testing mobile applications on iOS or Android devices. Currently, Playwright does not have native support for mobile testing but may add it in the future.

In summary, both Selenium and Playwright are powerful web automation frameworks with their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on factors such as language preference, browser requirements, execution speed needs, cross-browser consistency requirements, and the maturity of the ecosystem.
