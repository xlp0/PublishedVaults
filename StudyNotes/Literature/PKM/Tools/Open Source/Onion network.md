The Onion network, also known as Tor (The Onion Router), is a decentralized network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. It achieves this by routing internet traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers called "[[Tor relay|Tor relays]]" or "nodes," which encrypt and re-encrypt the data multiple times, making it difficult to trace back to the original user.

[[Jacob Appelbaum]] is a former technology developer and advocate for online privacy and anonymity. He was associated with the Tor Project, an organization that develops and maintains the Tor software. Applebaum worked as a core member of the project, contributing to its development and promoting online privacy rights.

However, in 2016, allegations of sexual misconduct were made against Jacob Applebaum by multiple women within the tech community. These allegations led to his resignation from the Tor Project and subsequent distancing from the organization. It's important to note that these allegations are separate from his contributions to Tor and do not directly impact how people use or understand the Onion network itself.
