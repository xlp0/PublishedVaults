Fab City [[OS]] is an innovative platform that empowers the [[Fab Labs]] and Fab City community to collaborate and create sustainable, self-sufficient cities. It serves as a digital infrastructure that connects makers, designers, and citizens to share knowledge, resources, and ideas.

At its core, Fab City OS is driven by the principles of open-source collaboration and decentralized production. It enables individuals to design and fabricate products locally using digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines. By embracing the concept of distributed manufacturing, Fab City OS reduces the reliance on global supply chains and promotes local production. As an operating system, it provides the governance functions of [[DIDO|Data In/Data Out]].

The platform also emphasizes the importance of circular economy practices. It encourages participants to utilize recycled materials, promote repairability, and design for longevity. By adopting a circular approach to manufacturing, we aim to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency. To assess the waste incurred or efficiency, one may also see the [[The Four Key Metrics|Four Key Metrics]] by [[DORA]].

Fab City OS fosters a strong sense of community by connecting individuals with similar interests and goals. It allows makers to share their designs, collaborate on projects, and provide feedback to improve each other's work. This collaborative ecosystem nurtures creativity and innovation while promoting a culture of knowledge sharing.

Furthermore, Fab City OS integrates with existing urban infrastructure to transform cities into self-sufficient ecosystems. By encouraging local production of goods and services, it reduces transportation needs while fostering economic growth within communities. The platform also provides tools for monitoring resource consumption and managing energy systems effectively.

In summary, Fab City OS is an inclusive digital platform that empowers the Fab Labs and Fab City community to create sustainable cities through open-source collaboration, decentralized production, circular economy practices, and community engagement. Together, we can build a future where cities are not only environmentally friendly but also economically vibrant.
