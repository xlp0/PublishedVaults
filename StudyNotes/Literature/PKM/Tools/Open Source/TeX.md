[[TeX]] is a typesetting system created by [[Donald Knuth]], a computer scientist and mathematician, in the late 1970s. It was designed to provide precise control over the layout and formatting of documents, particularly for scientific and mathematical content. TeX is known for its exceptional typesetting quality and its ability to handle complex documents with ease.

Here are some key features and characteristics of TeX:

1. **Typesetting Quality**: TeX is renowned for its high-quality typesetting, producing visually appealing and professional-looking documents. It handles aspects such as line breaking, hyphenation, kerning, font design, and mathematical typesetting with great precision.

2. **Macros and Control Sequences**: TeX allows users to define their own macros and control sequences to extend its functionality. These custom macros enable users to create reusable commands, automate repetitive tasks, and tailor TeX to their specific needs.

3. **Plain TeX**: The core TeX system provides a plain format called "Plain TeX." It serves as a minimal set of macros and control sequences, offering a low-level programming language for document creation. Plain TeX gives users direct control over the typesetting process but requires more effort and expertise.

4. **TeX-based Formats**: Various formats built on top of TeX have been developed to simplify document creation. [[LaTeX]] is the most popular format, providing a higher-level language that abstracts many low-level details and focuses on document structure and content. Other formats include ConTeXt, AMS-TeX, and more.

5. **Cross-Platform and Portability**: TeX is cross-platform and can run on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The source files are plain text, making them portable and compatible with different text editors and platforms.

6. **Mathematical Typesetting**: TeX excels at typesetting mathematical equations and symbols. It provides an extensive set of commands and features for expressing complex mathematical formulas, equations, and notations with exceptional precision.

7. **Community and Resources**: TeX has a large and dedicated community of users and developers. There are numerous resources, books, online forums, and packages available to assist users in learning and utilizing TeX effectively.

TeX requires a TeX distribution to compile source files into a final document. Popular TeX distributions include TeX Live, MiKTeX, and MacTeX. These distributions come with the necessary programs, fonts, and packages to process TeX files and generate output in various formats, such as PDF, DVI (Device Independent), or PostScript.

While TeX itself can be challenging to learn due to its low-level nature, it provides unparalleled control over typesetting and is highly valued by professionals in academia, publishing, and scientific communities. LaTeX, built on top of TeX, offers a more user-friendly and accessible approach to document creation while still harnessing the power and quality of the underlying TeX engine.
