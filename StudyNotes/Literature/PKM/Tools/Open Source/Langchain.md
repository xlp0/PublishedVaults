#Langchain #MoE


[Langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is a website that hosts the tool to develop applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:

- **Data-aware**: connect a language model to other sources of data
- **Agentic**: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:

1. **Components**: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.

## Use in Conjunction with other tools
It can be used with existing tools, such as [[ChatGPT]], [[PrivateGPT]], and [[GPT4Alll]] to automate content generation. More importantly, it should be integrated with powerful frontends, such as [[Obsidian]] to help users have many user interfaces to tap into different parts of the [[Langchain]] data workflow. It should also be organized based on the notion of [[Zettlekasten Workflow]], and the [[DevOps]] kind of workflow to better address the intention of participating agents, similar to what [[Donald Hoffman]] and [[Michael Levin]] talked about in the notion of [[Conscious Agency]].
