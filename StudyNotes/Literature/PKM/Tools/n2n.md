[n2n](https://www.ntop.org/products/n2n/) is a peer-to-peer VPN that uses libp2p to create a secure and decentralized network. It is a free and open-source project that is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

n2n works by creating a network of nodes, each of which is responsible for routing traffic between other nodes. This means that there is no central server that controls the network, which makes it more secure and resistant to censorship.

n2n also supports encryption, which helps to protect the privacy of users' traffic. Traffic between nodes is encrypted using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

To use n2n, you need to install the n2n software on your computer. Once the software is installed, you can create a new network or join an existing network. You can then connect to other nodes in the network and start routing traffic.

n2n is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Bypassing censorship: n2n can be used to bypass censorship by routing traffic through a network of nodes that are not subject to censorship.
- Improving privacy: n2n can be used to improve privacy by encrypting traffic between nodes.
- Creating a more secure network: n2n can be used to create a more secure network by eliminating the need for a central server.

If you are looking for a secure and decentralized VPN, n2n is a good option to consider.

Here are some of the features of n2n:

- **Decentralized:** There is no central server, which makes it more secure and resistant to censorship.
- **Encrypted:** Traffic between nodes is encrypted using TLS.
- **Easy to use:** The software is easy to install and use.
- **Versatile:** Can be used for a variety of purposes, such as bypassing censorship, improving privacy, and creating a more secure network.
