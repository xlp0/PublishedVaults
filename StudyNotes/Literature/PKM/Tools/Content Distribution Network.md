A [[Content Distribution Network]] ([[Content Distribution Network|CDN]]) is a network of servers located in different geographic locations that work together to deliver web content efficiently to end users. CDNs are designed to improve the performance, reliability, and availability of websites and other online content.

CDNs work by caching or replicating content from the origin server (where the content is originally hosted) onto multiple edge servers located in various data centers around the world. When a user requests a particular piece of content, the CDN automatically routes the request to the nearest edge server instead of directly going to the origin server. This reduces latency and improves load times as the content is delivered from a server closer to the user.

CDNs also help in handling high traffic loads and mitigating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. By distributing content across multiple servers, CDNs can handle larger volumes of traffic without overwhelming any single server. This ensures that websites remain accessible even during peak usage periods.

Furthermore, CDNs offer additional features like automatic file compression, image optimization, and caching techniques such as browser caching and dynamic caching. These optimizations help reduce bandwidth usage and further improve website performance.

In summary, CDNs play a crucial role in delivering web content efficiently by reducing latency, improving load times, handling high traffic loads, and enhancing overall website performance. They are widely used by businesses of all sizes to provide a better user experience for their online visitors.
