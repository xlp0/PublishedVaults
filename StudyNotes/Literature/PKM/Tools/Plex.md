Plex is a popular media server and streaming platform that allows users to organize, stream, and access their own media collections from various devices. It was developed by Plex Inc., formerly known as Plex Media Server, and has gained a large user base since its launch in 2009.

With Plex, users can store their movies, TV shows, music, photos, and other media files on a central server or computer. This media server software organizes the content into an easy-to-navigate library and automatically fetches metadata like cover art, plot summaries, ratings, and more from various online sources.

Once the media is organized on the server, users can access it from any device with the Plex app installed. The platform supports a wide range of devices including smartphones (iOS and Android), tablets, smart TVs, streaming boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), gaming consoles (such as PlayStation or Xbox), and web browsers.

One of the key features of Plex is its ability to transcode media files on-the-fly. This means that even if the original file format is not compatible with a particular device or network speed, Plex will convert it in real-time to ensure smooth playback without compromising quality.

In addition to personal media collections, Plex also offers access to a variety of free ad-supported streaming content through its platform. Users can discover and watch movies, TV shows, documentaries, news channels, podcasts, web series, and more without any subscription fees.

Furthermore, Plex offers premium features through a subscription called "Plex Pass." This subscription unlocks additional benefits such as offline downloads for mobile devices, DVR capabilities for recording live TV with compatible tuners or antenna setups, automatic photo tagging using artificial intelligence technology called "Plex Auto Tags," early access to new features and updates, exclusive discounts on partner products/services, and more.
