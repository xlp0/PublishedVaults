#PKC 

[[Proxmox]] is an open-source server virtualization management platform that allows users to manage and deploy virtual machines (VMs) and containers. It is based on Debian Linux and provides a web-based interface for easy management of the virtualization infrastructure.

Proxmox can be integrated with [[Network Attached Storage|Network-Attached Storage]] (NAS) devices to store and manage VM images, backups, and other data. NAS systems provide centralized storage that can be accessed by multiple Proxmox hosts, allowing for better scalability and flexibility. Proxmox supports various NAS protocols such as NFS (Network File System), CIFS (Common Internet File System), and iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface).

Overall, Proxmox provides a comprehensive solution for managing virtual machines and containers in a data center or cloud environment. Its integration with NAS systems enhances storage capabilities while PKC enables efficient resource utilization through lightweight containerization.
