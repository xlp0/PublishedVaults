<a href="http://pkc.pub">PKC</a> stands for [[PKC|Personal Knowledge Container]], which is a way to conduct [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management]].


## The original text from pkc.pub

 "PKC" in Chinese is [[個人知識容器]] is a way to help attain personalized [[Data Sovereignty]]  through [[Personal Cloud]] technologies. It is a collection of (initially Docker-based) microservices (computation and communication processes)that enables personalized ownership of Hyperlink-centric data assets. It is a tool designed to be operated by individuals or communities of varying sizes and can be deployed to network environments of your choice primarily using Docker-based container technologies. After the installation of "PKC", your local PKC instance will work, even without access to the Internet. PKC allows for an integrative deployment of user-friendly knowledge presentation, extensible functionalities, and self-servicing data asset ownership in a single package. In other words, this technology platform is designed to lower the entry barrier for the ownership of self-sovereign data assets.



PKC, or Personal Knowledge Container, is a concept that aims to provide individuals with personalized data sovereignty through the use of [[Personal Cloud]] technologies. It is a collection of microservices that allow individuals to have ownership over their own data assets. PKC can be operated by individuals or communities and can be deployed in various network environments using Docker-based container technologies.

Once installed, PKC can function even without internet access. It offers user-friendly knowledge presentation, extensible functionalities, and self-servicing data asset ownership in a single package. The goal of PKC is to make it easier for individuals to own their self-sovereign data assets by reducing the barriers to entry. A popular implementation is [[Network Attached Storage]] ([[Network Attached Storage|NAS]]), which basically has most of the functionality of [[PKC]].

PKC was developed in context with [[XLP]] and the [[Science of Governance|SoG]]. A way to organize content knowledge can be considered to be an [[Intentional Workflow]], which can be implemented using [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]. It is also an embodiment of a [[Conscious Agency]]. Initially, it also must have many plug-ins for existing [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] tools to extract data for inputs and metrics of individual users and agencies.  It needs to use [[Blockchain]], [[Smart Contract|Smart Contracts]], and [[IPFS]] to realize its reach.
