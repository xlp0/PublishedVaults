A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a computer system that behaves like a separate physical computer. It runs on a host operating system and allows multiple guest operating systems to be run simultaneously on the same physical hardware. Each virtual machine operates as an independent entity with its own virtual hardware, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.

Virtual machines are commonly used for various purposes such as server consolidation, software testing and development, running legacy applications, creating isolated environments for security purposes, and providing cloud computing services. They offer flexibility, scalability, and cost savings by maximizing the utilization of hardware resources and enabling easier management and deployment of applications across different platforms.

## Containerization Technology and Virtual Machine
Tell me about Virtual Machine in the world of containerization technology such as docker

In the world of containerization technology like Docker, a [[Virtual Machine|virtual machine]] (VM) plays a different role compared to traditional virtualization techniques.

Virtual machines are a form of hardware virtualization, where an entire operating system and its applications are abstracted from the underlying physical hardware. This approach allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical server, each with its own operating system instance. Each VM runs independently and is isolated from other VMs.

On the other hand, Docker containers use containerization technology, which is a form of operating system-level virtualization. Containers provide an isolated environment for running applications and their dependencies, but they share the host operating system kernel. This shared kernel makes containers lightweight and enables faster startup times compared to VMs.

However, in certain scenarios, it may still be necessary to use virtual machines alongside containers:

1. Legacy Applications: If you have legacy applications that cannot be easily containerized or require specific operating systems or configurations, running them inside a VM can be a viable option.

2. Security Isolation: In situations where you need stronger isolation between multiple applications or services, using separate VMs could provide an additional layer of security compared to containers sharing the same kernel.

3. Resource Management: Virtual machines allow you to allocate specific CPU cores, memory sizes, and network interfaces to each instance. This level of resource management might be necessary for certain workloads that demand strict resource allocation.

4. Hybrid Deployments: Virtual machines can be used alongside containers in hybrid deployments where some components run in containers while others run in traditional virtual machines or on bare metal.

Overall, while containerization technology like Docker has gained popularity due to its portability and scalability advantages over traditional virtualization approaches, there are still cases where utilizing virtual machines remains relevant and beneficial in the world of containerization.
