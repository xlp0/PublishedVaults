Containerization technology refers to the practice of packaging software into self-contained units, known as containers. These containers include all the necessary dependencies and libraries needed for the software to run consistently across different computing environments.

[[Docker]] is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. It provides an isolated environment for applications to run, ensuring consistency and portability.

Other examples of containerization technologies include:

1. Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

2. LXC/LXD: Linux Containers (LXC) is an operating system-level virtualization method that allows multiple Linux distributions to run on a single host. LXD is a system container manager built on top of LXC.

3. rkt: Pronounced as "rocket," rkt is an open-source container runtime developed by CoreOS. It focuses on security, simplicity, and composability.

4. OpenVZ: A Linux-based operating system-level virtualization technology that allows multiple isolated Linux instances (containers) to run on a single physical server.

5. Windows Containers: Microsoft provides containerization technology for Windows-based applications using Docker-compatible containers or their native Windows Server Containers.

These examples showcase different approaches to containerization, each with its own set of features and benefits for software development and deployment.
