#WASM

WebAssembly, often referred to as Wasm, is a binary instruction format designed for web browsers. It is a low-level bytecode format that allows running code written in languages such as C, C++, Rust, and others on the web. WebAssembly aims to provide efficient and secure execution of code in web browsers at near-native speeds.

One of the main motivations behind WebAssembly is to overcome the limitations of [[JavaScript]] as the only language for web development. JavaScript has its advantages but can be slow for computationally-intensive tasks. With WebAssembly, developers can write performance-critical parts of their applications in languages that are closer to the hardware and compile them into Wasm bytecode.

WebAssembly is designed to be a portable format that can run on any platform, not just web browsers. It provides a sandboxed environment with security features like memory isolation and prevents direct access to the underlying system. This ensures that executing WebAssembly code does not compromise user safety or privacy.

To run WebAssembly in a browser, it needs to be loaded alongside JavaScript using an API called "WebAssembly JavaScript API." This API allows developers to load and execute [[WebAssembly|Wasm]] modules, interact with them from JavaScript, and vice versa.

WebAssembly has gained significant momentum since its introduction in 2017 and has been adopted by major browser vendors like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. Its widespread support makes it a promising technology for various use cases such as gaming, multimedia processing, scientific simulations, virtual reality (VR), and more.

In summary, WebAssembly is a binary instruction format that enables high-performance execution of code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web. It provides faster loading times for web applications and opens doors for new possibilities in web development by allowing developers to leverage their existing skills in other programming languages.
