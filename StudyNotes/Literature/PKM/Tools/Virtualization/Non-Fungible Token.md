Tell me about NFT in terms of blockchain

[[Non-Fungible Token|NFT]], or [[Non-Fungible Token]], is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content. It is built on blockchain technology, which provides transparency, security, and immutability.

Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and indivisible. Each NFT has distinct characteristics that differentiate it from other tokens, making it stand out as an original item in the digital world.

NFTs leverage blockchain's decentralized ledger system to ensure provenance and verification of ownership. The information about an NFT is stored on the blockchain in the form of a token contract, which contains details like the token ID, metadata (describing the asset), and references to associated files or content.

Blockchain technology ensures that NFTs cannot be duplicated or tampered with. Every transaction involving an NFT is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent history of ownership transfers. This makes it possible to track the complete lifecycle of an NFT from creation to present ownership.

Smart contracts play a crucial role in the functionality of NFTs. They allow creators to set specific rules regarding royalties or commissions earned whenever their NFT is sold in secondary markets. These smart contracts automate these processes and ensure that creators receive their share automatically without relying on intermediaries.

NFTs have gained significant popularity for various use cases such as digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, music albums, domain names, and more. They enable artists and creators to monetize their work directly by selling it as an NFT without traditional gatekeepers like galleries or auction houses.

While NFTs have opened up new possibilities for digital ownership and value creation on blockchain platforms, there have been concerns about environmental impact due to the energy consumption associated with some blockchains. Additionally, there have been instances of copyright infringement and fraud in the NFT space, highlighting the need for careful evaluation and due diligence when engaging with NFTs.

### Compared to Soul Bound Token

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) and [[Soul Bound Token]] (SBT) are both types of digital tokens, but they have some key differences. Here's a comparison between the two:

1. Definition:
   - NFT: NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item or piece of content, such as artwork, music, videos, virtual real estate, etc.
   - SBT: Soul Bound Tokens are a type of digital token specifically designed for gaming platforms. They represent unique in-game items or characters with certain attributes and abilities.

2. Use Case:
   - NFT: NFTs have a broader range of use cases beyond gaming. They can be used in art galleries and marketplaces, music platforms, virtual reality experiences, collectibles, etc.
   - SBT: SBTs are primarily used within gaming ecosystems to enhance gameplay by providing unique items or characters that players can own and trade.

3. Interoperability:
   - NFT: NFTs are often built on blockchain platforms like [[Ethereum]], which enables interoperability across various marketplaces and applications. They can be bought, sold, and transferred between different platforms.
   - SBT: SBTs may not always have the same level of interoperability as NFTs since they are usually designed for specific gaming platforms or ecosystems. Their transferability might be limited within the game or associated marketplace.

4. Value Proposition:
   - NFT: The value proposition of NFTs lies in their uniqueness and scarcity. Artists can sell their digital artwork directly to buyers without intermediaries, creators can monetize digital content through tokenization, and collectors can own exclusive items with proof of ownership.
   - SBT: The value proposition of SBTs is centered around enhancing the gaming experience. Players can own rare or powerful in-game items that give them an advantage or hold special attributes. SBTs also allow players to trade or sell their virtual assets.

5. Marketplaces:
   - NFT: NFTs have gained significant traction in recent years, and there are numerous marketplaces dedicated to buying, selling, and trading NFTs. Some popular platforms include OpenSea, Rarible, NBA Top Shot, etc.
   - SBT: Soul Bound Tokens are usually traded on gaming-specific marketplaces or within the game ecosystem itself. Examples of such platforms include Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Gods Unchained, etc.
