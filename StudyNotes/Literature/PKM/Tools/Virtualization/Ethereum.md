Tell me about Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and [[Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/dApp|decentralized applications]] ([[Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/dApp|dApps]]). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer, in late 2013 and launched in July 2015.

Unlike [[Bitcoin]], which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum aims to provide a platform for developers to build and deploy their own decentralized applications on top of its blockchain. It features its own native currency called [[Ether]] ([[Ether|ETH]]), which is used to facilitate transactions and incentivize network participants.

One of Ethereum's key innovations is the concept of smart contracts. These are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions written directly into lines of code. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries in transactions, enabling direct peer-to-peer interactions with enhanced security.

Ethereum introduced its own programming language called Solidity, which allows developers to write smart contracts and dApps on the platform. This has led to a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications being built on Ethereum, ranging from financial services and gaming to supply chain management and identity verification systems.

Ethereum employs a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) called Ethereum 2.0 (or ETH2). This upgrade aims to improve scalability, energy efficiency, and security by transitioning from the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. The migration from PoW to PoS will occur in multiple phases over several years.

Additionally, Ethereum has its own decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem that allows users to access various financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges, and more directly from their crypto wallets. This has been a major driving force behind the recent growth in popularity and adoption of Ethereum.

Overall, Ethereum has become one of the most influential blockchain platforms due to its ability to support smart contracts and enable the development of decentralized applications with real-world utility across various industries.
