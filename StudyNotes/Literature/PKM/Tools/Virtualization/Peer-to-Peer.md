#P2P 

In the world of blockchain, [[Peer-to-Peer|peer-to-peer]] (P2P) refers to a decentralized network where participants interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. It is a fundamental concept that underlies the functioning of blockchain technology.

In traditional systems, such as centralized networks or client-server architectures, there is a central authority or intermediary that facilitates communication and transactions between participants. However, in a [[P2P]] network, every participant acts as both a client and a server, enabling direct interaction between them.

In the context of blockchain, P2P networks are crucial for achieving consensus and maintaining the integrity of the distributed ledger. When a transaction is initiated on the blockchain, it is broadcasted to all participants in the network. These participants (or nodes) validate and verify the transaction independently by referring to previous transactions stored in their copy of the blockchain.

P2P networks ensure that no single entity or central authority has complete control over the system. This decentralized nature provides several benefits, including:

1. Increased resilience: P2P networks are more resilient to failures or attacks since there is no single point of failure.
2. Improved security: As transactions are verified by multiple nodes in a P2P network, it becomes more difficult for malicious actors to manipulate or tamper with data.
3. Lower costs: By eliminating intermediaries, P2P networks can reduce transaction fees and operational costs.
4. Enhanced privacy: Since transactions occur directly between peers, sensitive information does not need to pass through third-party intermediaries.

Overall, P2P networks play a crucial role in enabling trustless interactions within blockchain systems by promoting decentralization and removing the need for intermediaries.

## Peer-to-Peer Connection

One Page. 9 (Section 1.3.3) of [[@preukschatSelfsovereignIdentityDecentralized2021|Self-sovereign identity_2021]],  The following statement was said:
> In a peer-to-peer relationship, neither of you has an “[[Account|account]]” with the other. Rather, you both share a connection. Neither of you fully “owns” this connection. It is like a string that you are both holding—if either one of you lets go, the string will drop. But as long as you both want it, the connection will persist.
