With Miro Visual Notes, we **UNLOCK AN ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION FORMAT** for our users, enriching visual collaboration with a **FULLY FUNCTIONAL TEXT EDITOR**, **AND ELIMINATING THE NEED TO SWITCH** between our online collaborative whiteboarding platform and external note-taking apps.

Miro’s Visual Notes lives within each of your Miro boards. Now you can do anything you would in any other text editing tool – and more.

Our most recent addition to Miro functionality is designed to change the way you interact with your boards.

Miro is perfect for unstructured visual collaboration, but before now it was challenging to create **STRUCTURED WORK OUTPUTS** such as business cases, project status reports, and project summaries without leaving your board.
