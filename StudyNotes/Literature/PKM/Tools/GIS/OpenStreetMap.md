[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) ([[OpenStreetMap|OSM]]) is a collaborative, free and open-source mapping project. It was created in 2004 with the goal of providing a free alternative to proprietary mapping data and services. OpenStreetMap allows anyone to view, edit, and use geographic data using a variety of tools and platforms.

The main feature of OpenStreetMap is its editable map data. Thousands of volunteers from around the world contribute to the project by mapping roads, buildings, landmarks, and other geographic features. These contributions are made through various editing tools that allow users to add, modify or delete map elements.

OpenStreetMap data is stored in a structured format known as "nodes," "ways," and "relations." Nodes represent individual points on the map such as street corners or landmarks. Ways are sequences of nodes that define linear features like roads or rivers. Relations are used to describe complex relationships between multiple entities.

The project provides a range of tools for accessing and utilizing the map data. The most common way to view OpenStreetMap is through its website, where users can search for specific locations and view detailed maps. Additionally, developers can access the raw OSM data for their own applications through an API (Application Programming Interface).

OpenStreetMap has gained popularity because it offers several advantages over traditional mapping solutions. Firstly, it allows users to freely access and use the map data without any licensing restrictions. This makes it an attractive option for individuals, organizations, and businesses seeking geospatial information.

Furthermore, OpenStreetMap provides a platform for customization and innovation. Since its data is open-source, developers have the freedom to build upon it or create new applications that utilize the map data in unique ways. This has resulted in a wide range of third-party tools and services built on top of OpenStreetMap.

OpenStreetMap has been widely adopted across various industries including transportation planning, urban development, emergency response management, tourism, navigation systems, and more. Many commercial map providers also use OpenStreetMap as a base layer for their own maps.

Overall, OpenStreetMap is a community-driven project that aims to create and maintain a free and open mapping resource for the entire world. With its collaborative approach and accessible data, it has become a valuable alternative to proprietary mapping solutions.
