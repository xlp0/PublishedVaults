[[MediaWiki]] is a free and [[OSS|open-source]] wiki software that allows users to collaboratively create and edit content on a website. It was originally developed for Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, but has since been adopted by many organizations and individuals for various purposes.

One of the key features of MediaWiki is its ability to organize and manage knowledge in a structured manner. It provides users with tools to create articles, categorize them, link related articles, and create a hierarchical structure of content. This makes it an ideal platform for personal knowledge management.

By using MediaWiki for personal knowledge management, individuals can create their own personal wiki or knowledge base. They can document their thoughts, ideas, research findings, notes from books or articles they have read, and any other information they find valuable. The software allows them to organize this information into categories or topics, making it easy to navigate and find relevant content.

MediaWiki also supports collaborative editing, which means multiple users can contribute to the same wiki. This feature can be useful for teams or communities who want to collectively manage their knowledge base or collaborate on projects.

Another important aspect of MediaWiki is its search functionality. Users can search within the wiki to quickly find specific information they are looking for. The software also supports full-text indexing and searching capabilities, which makes it easier to locate relevant content within large wikis.

Furthermore, MediaWiki allows users to customize the appearance and functionality of their wiki through extensions and skins. This means individuals can tailor their personal knowledge management system according to their needs and preferences.
