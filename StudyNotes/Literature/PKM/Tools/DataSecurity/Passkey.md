Passkey is a cross-device [[Authentication|authentication]] technology that helps users manage passwords or data access rights with some physical devices. An initial introductory [[@googlechromedevelopersUnderstandPasskeysMinutes2023|video by Google can be found here]]. Passkey is a protocol being promoted by [[FIDO]].

What is an [[Multi-Factor Authentication]] in the context of data /IT Security industry?

In the context of data/IT security industry, MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication. It is a security measure that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification in order to access a system or application. This typically involves combining something the user knows (e.g., a password), something the user has (e.g., a physical token or mobile device), and/or something the user is (e.g., biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition) to verify their identity. By using multiple factors, MFA adds an extra layer of security to protect against unauthorized access or identity theft.

According to the [[@PasswordlessSigninForms2022|page]] forwarded to me by [[Andrea D'Intino]], Passkey might be implemented using [[WebAuthn]].
