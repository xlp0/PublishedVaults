[[Multi-Factor Authentication]] ([[Multi-Factor Authentication|MFA]]) is a security mechanism that verifies a user's identity by requiring them to provide multiple pieces of evidence or factors. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond traditional username and password authentication, as it ensures that even if one factor is compromised, the attacker would still need to bypass additional factors.

There are generally three main types of factors used in MFA:

1. Something you know: This factor includes passwords, PINs, or any other knowledge-based information that only the user should know.

2. Something you have: This factor involves possessing a physical device such as a mobile phone, smart card, token, or key fob that generates [[One-time password|one-time passwords]] ([[One-time password|OPTs]]) or acts as a security key.

3. Something you are: This factor refers to biometric characteristics like fingerprints, retina scans, facial recognition, voice recognition, or any other unique physical attribute.

[[Passkey]] technologies can be used in conjunction with MFA to provide an additional factor of authentication. A passkey is typically a randomly generated string of characters that is unique to each user and device. It serves as a digital signature for authentication purposes.

When using MFA with Passkey technologies, the passkey becomes the "something you have" factor. The user would enter their username and password as the "something they know" factor and then also provide the passkey associated with their account as the second factor. The passkey may be stored on a physical device like a smartphone app or generated by an authentication server and delivered via SMS or email.

By combining these two factors (knowledge-based and possession-based), MFA with Passkey technologies greatly enhances security by mitigating risks associated with stolen passwords or compromised accounts. It ensures that even if an attacker manages to obtain the username and password, they would still need access to the specific passkey tied to that user's account in order to authenticate successfully.
