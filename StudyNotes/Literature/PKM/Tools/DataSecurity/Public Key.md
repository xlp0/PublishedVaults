Public Key refers to a cryptographic key that is used for encryption and is made available to the public. It is part of the asymmetric encryption system, which involves a pair of keys - a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely shared and used by anyone to encrypt data or messages intended for the owner of the corresponding [[Private Key|private key]].

When someone wants to send an encrypted message to the owner of a public key, they use this public key to encrypt the message. Once encrypted, only the owner of the corresponding private key can decrypt and read the message.

Public keys are commonly used in various cryptographic systems, including secure communication protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), as well as digital signatures. They play a crucial role in ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity in communication and data exchange.
