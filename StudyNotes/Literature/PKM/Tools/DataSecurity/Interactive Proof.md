Interactive proof is a concept in theoretical computer science that involves the interaction between a prover and a verifier to determine the correctness of a statement or problem. In an interactive proof, the prover tries to convince the verifier of the truthfulness of a statement by providing evidence or arguments, and the verifier checks this evidence to determine if it is convincing enough.

The main idea behind interactive proofs is to enable efficient verification of complex statements or problems without requiring the verifier to have complete knowledge or computational power. Instead, the prover assists the verifier by providing additional information or performing certain computations that help convince the verifier about the truthfulness of the statement.

Interactive proofs are designed in such a way that they can be efficiently verified even if the original problem is computationally hard. This makes them useful in various areas of computer science, including cryptography, complexity theory, and artificial intelligence. Interactive proofs have been extensively studied and applied in different contexts, such as [[ZKP|zero-knowledge proofs]], probabilistically checkable proofs, and interactive proof systems.

# The progenitors of Interactive Proof Systems

The progenitor of Interactive Proof Systems is [[Shafi Goldwasser]]. Along with [[Silvio Micali]] and [[Charles Rackoff]], she introduced the concept of Interactive Proof Systems in their groundbreaking paper titled "The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems" in 1985. This paper laid the foundation for this area of research and has had a significant impact on theoretical computer science and cryptography.
