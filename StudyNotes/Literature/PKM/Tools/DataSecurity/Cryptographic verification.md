Cryptographic verification refers to the process of confirming the integrity, authenticity, and correctness of data or information using cryptographic techniques. It involves the use of cryptographic algorithms and protocols to ensure that data has not been altered or tampered with during transmission or storage.

Cryptographic verification typically involves two main components: hashing and digital signatures.

1. [[Hashing]]: A cryptographic hash function is used to convert an input (data or message) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is known as a hash value or hash code. The hash function ensures that even a minor change in the input will result in a completely different hash value. By comparing the hash values of the original and received data, one can verify if any modifications have occurred.

2. [[Digital Signature|Digital Signatures]]: Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. They are created using asymmetric encryption techniques, where a private key is used to generate the signature, and a corresponding public key is used for verification. The digital signature ensures that the message was not modified during transit and that it was indeed sent by the claimed sender.

Cryptographic verification is widely used in various applications such as secure communication protocols, digital certificates, secure storage systems, electronic transactions, software distribution, and more. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data security and trustworthiness in modern computing systems.
