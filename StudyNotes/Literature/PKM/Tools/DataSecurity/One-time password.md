A [[One-time password|one-time password]] (OTP) is a unique and temporary password that is generated for each login attempt or transaction. It provides an additional layer of security to authenticate users in various systems and applications. OTPs are typically valid for only a short period, usually a few minutes, and become invalid once used or expired.

OTP is commonly used in conjunction with Multi-Factor Authentication ([[Multi-Factor Authentication|MFA]]) to enhance the security of user logins. MFA is a security measure that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification before granting access to a system or application. By combining something the user knows (such as a [[Password|password]]), something the user has (such as a physical token or smartphone), and sometimes something the user is (such as [[Biometric]] data), MFA significantly strengthens the authentication process.

OTP serves as the "something you have" factor in MFA. When logging in or performing sensitive transactions, users are prompted to enter their OTP along with their regular username and password. The OTP can be delivered through various mediums, such as SMS messages, email, mobile apps, hardware tokens, or even voice calls. Since the OTP changes every time, it adds an extra layer of security because even if someone intercepts an OTP, it becomes useless after its single use or expiration.

By incorporating OTP into MFA, the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised passwords alone is minimized. Even if an attacker obtains someone's credentials (username and password), they would still need access to the user's device or authentication method to obtain the OTP for successful authentication.

Overall, OPT in combination with MFA provides an additional barrier against unauthorized access by adding another layer of verification beyond just passwords.
