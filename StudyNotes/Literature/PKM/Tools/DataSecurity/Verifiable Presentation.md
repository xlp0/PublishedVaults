A [Verifiable Presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations) as defined by [[W3C]] is stated as follows:
> A verifiable presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of [[Cryptographic verification|cryptographic verification]].

It is a form of digital identity proof that can be presented and verified by a third party. It is a way to securely and reliably share personal information or attributes without disclosing unnecessary or sensitive details.

Verifiable Presentations are typically based on decentralized identity technologies, such as blockchain or distributed ledger technology. They allow individuals to store their personal information, such as age, address, education, qualifications, or credentials, in a self-sovereign manner. This means that individuals have full control over their data and can choose when and with whom they share it.

When a Verifiable Presentation is presented to a third party for verification, the third party can verify the authenticity and integrity of the information by checking the cryptographic proofs attached to the presentation. This eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries to vouch for an individual's identity, reducing fraud risks and enhancing privacy.

Verifiable Presentations have applications in various domains such as digital identity systems, employment verification, academic qualifications verification, healthcare records management, and more. They provide individuals with greater control over their personal data while enabling secure and trusted interactions with organizations or service providers.
