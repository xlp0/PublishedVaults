#zenroom

[[Zenroom]] is an open-source software technology developed by [[Dyne.org]]. Technically, it is a secure language interpreter of a domain specific language, called [[Zencode]], designed to execute cryptographic operations. It also can be used to encode and execute smart contracts in a multi-platform environment, including platforms that runs [[WebAssembly]].  Its simple syntactic structure, is based on [[Hoare triple]] format, makes it an ideal platform to encode causal relations, and therefore can be used to implement not only executable code, but also use it as a way to annotate data assets, serving as a cryptographically verified tool for implementing [[Literate programming]]. 

Zenroom focuses on providing a secure execution environment for [[dApp|decentralized applications]] ([[dApp]]) and smart contracts. It allows developers to write code in [[Lua]], a lightweight scripting language, and execute it securely within a sandboxed environment. This ensures that code running on Zenroom cannot access unauthorized resources or perform malicious actions.

Key features of Zenroom include:

1. Privacy: Zenroom allows for the execution of cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and key generation. These operations can be performed securely without exposing sensitive information.

2. Trustworthiness: Zenroom uses cryptographic primitives to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data. It provides mechanisms for verifying the [[Correctness]] of code execution and preventing tampering.

3. Portability: Zenroom is designed to be portable across different platforms, including desktops, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. This enables developers to build secure applications for various environments.

4. Modularity: Zenroom follows a modular design, allowing developers to use specific components or libraries based on their requirements. This flexibility makes it easier to integrate Zenroom into existing software projects.

5. Community-driven development: Zenroom is an open-source project supported by a community of contributors who actively participate in its development and improvement. This ensures constant updates, bug fixes, and security enhancements.
