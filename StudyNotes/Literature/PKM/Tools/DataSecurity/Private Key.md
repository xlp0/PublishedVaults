A [[Private Key|private key]] is a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] key that is used in asymmetric cryptography. It is typically generated alongside a public key as part of a key pair. The private key is kept secret and is only known to the owner.

In [[Public Key|public-key]] cryptography, the private key is used for decrypting messages encrypted with the corresponding public key. It is also used for signing digital documents to provide authentication and integrity verification.

The security and confidentiality of the private key are crucial as anyone who possesses it can access encrypted information or impersonate the owner. Therefore, it should be protected and stored securely by using encryption and access control measures.
