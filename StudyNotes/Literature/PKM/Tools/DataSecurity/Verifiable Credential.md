In [[W3C]] terms, a Verifiable Credential (a.k.a. [[Cryptographic Badge]]) refers to a digital representation of information that is issued by an entity, such as an organization or individual, and can be verified by others. It is designed to provide proof of claims made by the issuer about the subject of the credential.

Verifiable Credentials follow a specific data model defined by the W3C's Verifiable Credentials Data Model specification. This model involves three key components: 

1. Issuer: The entity that issues the Verifiable Credential. It could be an organization, government agency, or any trusted party that has the authority to make claims about individuals or entities.

2. Holder: The subject of the Verifiable Credential who possesses and controls it. The holder may be an individual person or an organization.

3. Verifier: The entity that verifies the authenticity and integrity of the Verifiable Credential using cryptographic techniques. The verifier can independently assess the claims made in the credential without necessarily relying on a centralized authority.

Verifiable Credentials are typically stored digitally and can be shared securely and selectively with other parties using decentralized technologies like [[blockchain]] or distributed ledger technology (DLT). They enable individuals to have more control over their personal data by providing them with portable digital credentials that they can present when needed, eliminating the need for paper-based documents or reliance on centralized databases.

The W3C's work on Verifiable Credentials aims to establish standards for interoperability, privacy, and security in digital identity systems. It promotes open and decentralized approaches to identity verification while ensuring privacy protection and giving individuals greater agency over their personal information.
