Social login, also known as social sign-in or social media authentication, refers to the process of using existing social media credentials (such as those from Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) to log into a website or an application. It allows users to skip the traditional registration process by leveraging their social media accounts to authenticate and access various online platforms.

When a user chooses to log in with social media credentials, the website or application requests permission from the respective social media platform to access certain user data. Once authorized, the user is granted access without having to create a new account or remember additional login details.

Social login provides convenience for users by simplifying the login process and eliminating the need for creating and managing multiple usernames and passwords. It also benefits websites and applications by allowing them to gather valuable user information from their social media profiles, such as name, email address, profile picture, friend lists, etc., which can be used for personalized experiences and targeted marketing.

However, it is important for users to consider privacy concerns when opting for social login as they are granting access to their personal information. Websites and applications should also ensure secure implementation of social login protocols to protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse.
