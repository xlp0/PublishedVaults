#NCR #search

NCR stands for "No Country Redirect." The http://google.com/ncr option is a URL parameter that can be added to the Google search domain to prevent automatic country-specific redirects. When using this option, Google will not redirect the user to their country-specific version of the search engine and will instead display the international version, usually based in the United States.

When using Google search, it might force you to use certain website, such as Google.com.hk. To avoid it from forcing you to a particular region, use the NCR option:

```
http://google.com/ncr
```

By using the "NCR" option, it will remove Google's remembered preference to direct you to a default region.
