Microsoft PowerApps is a low-code development platform that allows users to create and deploy custom business applications without the need for extensive coding knowledge. It is a part of the Microsoft Power Platform, which also includes Power BI and Power Automate.

With PowerApps, users can build apps for various platforms such as web, mobile, and tablet. The platform provides a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and a range of connectors to integrate with data sources such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365, Excel, and more.

PowerApps offers a wide range of features and capabilities to create powerful applications. Users can customize the app's design using various controls, layouts, and themes. It also allows for the creation of forms with validation rules and conditional formatting.

PowerApps supports both canvas apps and model-driven apps. Canvas apps provide more flexibility in designing user interfaces using a blank canvas while model-driven apps offer a more structured approach based on data models defined in the Common Data Service (CDS).

Microsoft Common Data Service (CDS) is a cloud-based data storage and management platform that allows organizations to securely store and manage their business data. It is a key component of the Microsoft Power Platform, which also includes Power Apps, Power BI, and Power Automate.

CDS provides a unified and standardized data model, allowing users to easily connect different systems and applications. It offers a wide range of connectors to various Microsoft and third-party services, such as Dynamics 365, Office 365, Azure services, Salesforce, and more. This enables organizations to create powerful and integrated business solutions by leveraging their existing data sources.

4. Business logic: Users can define complex business rules and workflows using the built-in Power Apps Studio or through codeless configuration options. This allows organizations to automate processes and enforce consistency across their applications.

5. Extensibility: CDS provides developers with tools to extend its capabilities through customizing entities, creating plugins or custom code using the Common Data Model (CDM), building custom connectors using Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions.

6. Analytics: CDS integrates with Power BI for advanced analytics and reporting capabilities. Users can create interactive dashboards and visualizations based on their CDS data.

With Microsoft CDS, organizations can build custom applications using low-code or no-code tools like Power Apps while leveraging the underlying data management capabilities of CDS. It empowers users to quickly create, customize, and deploy business solutions that meet their unique requirements.
Users can publish their created apps to multiple platforms including web browsers, iOS devices, Android devices, and Windows devices. The platform also provides options for sharing the created apps with others within an organization or making them available publicly.
