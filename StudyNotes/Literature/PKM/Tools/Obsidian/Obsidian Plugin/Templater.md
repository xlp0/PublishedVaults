[[Templater]] is a plugin for the Obsidian note-taking software that allows users to create and use templates within their notes. It provides a way to quickly create structured and consistent notes by using predefined templates.

With Templater, users can create reusable templates for different types of notes, such as meeting notes, project plans, daily planners, or any other kind of structured information. These templates can include pre-filled sections or placeholders for information that needs to be filled in later.

Users can easily insert a template into their note by invoking a command or using a hotkey. The template is then inserted, and any placeholders are highlighted for easy editing. This allows users to quickly create new notes with consistent formatting and structure.

Templater also supports variables within templates, which can be used to automatically generate dynamic content based on user input or system variables. For example, a template could include variables for the current date, time, or project name, which are filled in automatically when the template is used.

Additionally, Templater supports nested templates, allowing users to include one template within another. This enables the creation of complex note structures with multiple levels of organization and detail.

Overall, Templater enhances the productivity and consistency of note-taking in Obsidian by providing a powerful tool for creating and using templates. It streamlines the process of creating structured notes and ensures that information is consistently captured across different types of notes.
