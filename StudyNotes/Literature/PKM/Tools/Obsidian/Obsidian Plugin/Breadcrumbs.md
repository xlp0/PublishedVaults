Breadcrumbs is an open-source plugin for [[Obsidian]], a popular note-taking and knowledge management tool. It enhances the navigation experience within Obsidian by providing a visual representation of the user's current location in the note hierarchy.

The plugin adds a breadcrumb trail at the top of the note editor, displaying the path of parent notes leading up to the current note. Each breadcrumb is clickable and allows users to quickly navigate to any parent note in their vault. This feature is particularly useful when working with nested or interconnected notes, as it helps users maintain context and easily move between related notes.

Breadcrumbs also include additional functionality such as keyboard shortcuts for navigating backward and forward through the breadcrumb trail, making it even more convenient to explore and traverse notes.

Being an open-source plugin, Breadcrumbs benefits from community contributions and improvements. Users can customize its appearance by modifying CSS styles or contribute to its development on GitHub.

Overall, Breadcrumbs adds a valuable navigation aid to Obsidian, enhancing its usability for users who prefer visual cues to navigate their knowledge base efficiently.
