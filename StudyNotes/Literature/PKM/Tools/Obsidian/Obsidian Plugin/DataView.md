[[Obsidian]] DataView is a powerful plugin for the Obsidian note-taking app that allows users to create dynamic tables, charts, and kanban boards from their notes. It enables users to organize and visualize their data in a structured format.

With [[DataView]], users can define custom templates to extract and display specific information from their notes. This allows for flexible data manipulation and presentation. Users can use simple query language syntax to filter, sort, and aggregate data based on various criteria.

The plugin supports different types of views such as tables, kanban boards, and charts like bar graphs or pie charts. These views can be embedded directly within Obsidian notes or used in separate files for more focused analysis.

DataView also provides various options for styling and customization, allowing users to tweak the appearance of their tables and visualizations according to their preferences. Additionally, it offers integration with other Obsidian plugins like DataviewJS to extend its functionality even further.

Overall, Obsidian DataView enhances the analytical capabilities of Obsidian by enabling users to transform their notes into structured data representations, facilitating better organization, understanding, and discovery of information within their knowledge base.

### What is the difference between DataviewJS and DataView?

[[DataviewJS]] and DataView are two different things with different purposes:

1. DataViewJS: DataViewJS is a JavaScript library that provides powerful data visualization capabilities. It is used to create interactive and dynamic charts, graphs, maps, and other visual representations of data on the web. DataViewJS offers various chart types, customization options, and interactivity features to help developers create visually appealing and informative data visualizations.

2. DataView: DataView is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to access and manipulate binary data directly. It allows you to interpret binary data in different formats such as integers, floats, strings, etc. by providing methods to get or set values at specific positions within the data buffer. The DataView object is particularly useful when working with network protocols or file formats that require dealing with binary data.

In summary, DataviewJS is a library for creating interactive data visualizations using JavaScript, while DataView is a native JavaScript object for manipulating binary data directly.
