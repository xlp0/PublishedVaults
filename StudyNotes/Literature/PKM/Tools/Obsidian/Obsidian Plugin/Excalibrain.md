ExcaliBrain is inspired by [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com/) and [Breadcrumbs](https://breadcrumbs-wiki.onrender.com/). It is an interactive, structured mind-map of your Obsidian Vault generated based on the folders and files in your Vault by interpreting the links, [[DataView]] fields, tags and YAML front matter in your markdown files.
