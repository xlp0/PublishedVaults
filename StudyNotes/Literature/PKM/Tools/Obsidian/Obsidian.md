[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) is a note-taking software that provides a [[personal knowledge management]] system for organizing and connecting your notes and thoughts. It is designed to work with plain text files, making it flexible and compatible across various platforms and devices.

One of the key features of Obsidian is its bidirectional linking capability. It allows you to create connections between different notes by using double brackets around the note's title. These links help in establishing relationships between ideas, making it easier to navigate and explore your notes.

The software also supports the use of Markdown formatting, which enables you to add headings, lists, images, code blocks, and more within your notes. This makes it convenient for both writing and structuring your content.

Obsidian offers a graph visualization feature called "Graph View." This feature displays an interconnected graph of all the linked notes, allowing you to visualize the relationships between them. It helps in understanding the connections and patterns within your knowledge base.

Another notable feature is its search functionality. You can search for keywords or phrases within your notes and quickly find relevant information. The search results are displayed in a sidebar, providing a preview of the matching content.

Additionally, Obsidian allows for customization through plugins and themes. You can extend its functionality by installing community-developed plugins or personalize its appearance with different themes.

Furthermore, Obsidian provides local storage for your data by default, allowing you to have complete control over your notes without relying on cloud services. However, if desired, you can choose to sync your files across devices using third-party cloud providers like Dropbox or iCloud.

Overall, Obsidian is well-suited for individuals who prefer a flexible note-taking system with powerful linking capabilities and customization options. Its focus on interconnectivity makes it an ideal tool for knowledge workers, researchers, writers, students, or anyone looking to organize their thoughts in a structured manner.
