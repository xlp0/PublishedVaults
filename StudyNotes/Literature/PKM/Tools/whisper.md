#ASR

Whisper is an [[ASR|automatic speech recognition]] ([[ASR]]) system developed by [[OpenAI]]. It is designed to convert spoken language into written text and is capable of transcribing audio recordings accurately. Whisper utilizes a deep learning architecture consisting of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and is trained on a massive amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.

Whisper has been trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data in order to ensure its effectiveness across various languages, accents, and contexts. It supports several languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Korean, and Arabic.

OpenAI's Whisper ASR system can be utilized in a variety of applications such as transcription services, voice assistants, voice command recognition systems, call center automation tools, and more. Its accuracy and flexibility make it a powerful tool for any task that involves converting audio into written text.

It's important to note that while Whisper provides accurate transcriptions most of the time, it may still produce errors or inaccuracies depending on the quality of the audio input or other factors. OpenAI actively encourages user feedback to help improve the system over time.
