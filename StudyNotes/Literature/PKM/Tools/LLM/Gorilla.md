Gorrilla is a [[Tool-LLM]], which means that it is trained to help users invoke [[API|APIs]] and perform tasks through those [[API|APIs]]. It is also known as the [[@promptengineeringGorillaAPIAppstore2023|API App Store for LLM]].

## A higher level intelligence
Using [[Tool-LLM]] technologies, such as [[Gorilla]], it is possible to ask a question and get a large number of existing services on the Internet to implement the task and provide responses for users. This is different from using a single data source, and trying to solve a problem using one's own resources. This indirection provides flexibility and extensibility but also creates a situation where all solutions became open-ended, it requires some additional mechanism to verify its trust-worthiness.
