#API

[[API]] stands for [[API|pplication Programming Interface]]. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that can be used to request certain actions or retrieve specific information from a software application or web service.

APIs enable developers to access certain functionalities or services provided by other applications, platforms, or services without having to understand the underlying code. They act as intermediaries, allowing different software systems to seamlessly exchange data and work together.

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as retrieving data from a database or server, integrating third-party services into an application, automating tasks, or building new applications on top of existing ones. They are commonly used in web development to enable communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server.

APIs can be exposed in different ways, including through web APIs (using HTTP protocols), libraries or software development kits (SDKs) that provide code interfaces for specific programming languages, or even hardware interfaces that allow interaction with physical devices.

## API with LLM
Tool-LLM, such as [[Gorilla]] is a way to integrated [[Generative Artificial Intelligence|Generative AI]] technologies with [[API]].

In recent years, with the rise of cloud computing and the proliferation of online services, APIs have become increasingly important for enabling integration between different systems and creating more interconnected applications and platforms. Many companies also provide public APIs that allow developers to build applications on top of their services and extend their functionality.
