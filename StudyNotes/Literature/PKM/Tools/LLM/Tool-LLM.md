#Tool-LLM

Tool-LLM is a groundbreaking AI model that excels at working with over 16,000 real-world APIs, making it 10 times more powerful than the [[Gorilla]] AI Model. Developed by experts from Meta, Microsoft, Stanford, and UC Berkeley, Tool-LLM can interact with various online services, adapt to new APIs, and is available on GitHub for users and developers. Dive into its capabilities, comparisons, and potential applications in industries like education, healthcare, and finance. It uses [[DFSDT]] as an algorithm to determine what [[API]] to be employed for the task.

## The importance of DFSDT
It is important to devise a strategy to traverse the solution space, so that solutions can be found with a reliable reasoning practice. The authors of [[Tool-LLM]] adopted [[DFSDT]] and their reasoning strategy is presented in the following diagram:
