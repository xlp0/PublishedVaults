[LogSeq](http://logseq.com) is an open-source note-taking and knowledge management tool. It is designed for users who prefer a plain text editor with a focus on simplicity and productivity. LogSeq allows you to create and organize your notes using a hierarchical structure, similar to a wiki or an outliner.

One of the key features of LogSeq is its ability to create bi-directional links between different notes. This means that you can easily connect related ideas and concepts, creating a network of interconnected thoughts. These links are dynamic, allowing you to navigate between notes effortlessly.

LogSeq also supports markdown formatting, making it easy to add headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting elements to your notes. You can also embed images and files within your notes for better organization.

Another notable feature of LogSeq is its support for queries and filters. You can use the built-in query language to search for specific information across your notes or filter them based on various criteria. This makes it easier to find relevant information when needed.

LogSeq is built on top of [[Git]] version control system, which means that all your notes are stored as plain text files in a Git repository. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with others using Git's branching and merging capabilities, and back up your data easily.

Overall, LogSeq aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for organizing and managing knowledge through its plain text editor, bi-directional linking, markdown support, query capabilities, and integration with Git version control system.
