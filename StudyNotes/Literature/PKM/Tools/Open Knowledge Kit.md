[[Celina Agaton]] is the Filipino-Canadian Founder of [[Open Knowledge Kit]] and regenerates supply chains in Indigenous, remote communities and creative industries to support governance, gender, and micro to medium enterprise. She improves research methods for faster, more accurate and verifiable methods with free and open source geospatial tools, and Youthmappers to create local data employment with mostly non-technical cross-sector women to address data, wage and investment gaps in gender, jobs and climate change.

Open Knowledge Kit empowers local communities with 2-17 times higher local wages and the stewardship of their own economic, climate, and social prosperity. 10 data collection, mapping and analytics tools provide continuous, and consistent data to strengthen prioritization, coordination and monitoring across sectors. The mapping program informs more equitable supply chains.
