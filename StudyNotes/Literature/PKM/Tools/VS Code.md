[[VS Code|Visual Studio Code]], commonly known as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by [[Microsoft]]. It is widely used by developers for various programming languages and is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

VS Code offers a rich set of features that enhance productivity and streamline the development workflow. It has built-in support for version control systems like Git, debugging capabilities, intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, code refactoring tools, and an extensive marketplace for extensions to personalize the editor according to individual needs.

Regarding its open-source nature, Visual Studio Code itself is not fully [[OSS|Open source software|open source]]. While it is built upon the Electron framework (which is open source), VS Code includes a mix of proprietary and open-source components. The source code for Visual Studio Code is available on [[GitHub]] under the MIT license with the "source-available" model. This means that you can view and modify the source code but have certain usage restrictions imposed by Microsoft.

Additionally, Microsoft also provides a separate open-source project called "VS Code - OSS" or "VSCodeium." It offers a fully open-source version of VS Code without any proprietary components included. This version can be used freely and modified as per the requirements of individual users or organizations.

In summary, while Visual Studio Code itself is not completely open source due to its mix of proprietary components, an alternative fully open-source version called VSCodeium exists that offers similar functionality.
