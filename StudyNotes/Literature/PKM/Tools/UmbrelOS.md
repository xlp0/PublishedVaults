UmbrelOS is an open-source operating system specifically designed for running a [[Bitcoin]] and Lightning Network full node. It is a self-hosted solution that allows users to easily set up and manage their own decentralized financial infrastructure.

The primary goal of UmbrelOS is to provide an accessible and user-friendly way for individuals to participate in the Bitcoin network by running their own full node. By doing so, users can verify their own transactions, contribute to the network's security, and support the principles of decentralization.

UmbrelOS offers a range of features that make it easy to set up and maintain a full node. It provides a simple-to-use web interface where users can manage their node, monitor its performance, update the software, and interact with various applications built on top of Bitcoin.
