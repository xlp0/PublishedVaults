ARM, originally Acorn RISC Machine, is a British semiconductor and software design company that specializes in developing computer chips and architectures. Founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Inc., and VLSI Technology, ARM is now a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.

ARM's history traces back to the 1980s when Acorn Computers developed the first ARM microprocessor. The company saw the potential of reduced instruction set computing ([[RISC]]) architecture and decided to create a new chip based on it. In partnership with Apple and VLSI Technology, ARM was established to further develop and license its RISC-based microprocessors.

The ARM architecture is a family of instruction sets that are known for their simplicity, energy efficiency, and high performance. It employs a load-store architecture where most arithmetic operations involve data transfer between registers, providing faster execution times than complex instruction set computing ([[CISC]]) architectures. The ARM instruction sets have evolved over time with different versions such as ARMv6, ARMv7, and ARMv8.

ARM's business model revolves around licensing its processor designs rather than manufacturing its own chips. It offers two main types of licenses: architecture licenses and processor licenses. Architecture licenses grant companies the ability to design their own processors using the ARM instruction sets while processor licenses provide access to pre-designed processor cores that can be integrated into various devices.

This business model has allowed ARM to establish itself as a dominant player in the mobile device market. Their low-power processors have become widely adopted in smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices due to their efficient power consumption. Additionally, their chip designs have expanded into other domains such as automotive systems, IoT devices, servers, and embedded systems.

In recent years, ARM has also ventured into developing technologies beyond processors. They invest in research and development for areas like graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cybersecurity. This diversification aims to cater to the evolving needs of the tech industry and maintain ARM's position as a leading provider of semiconductor technology.
