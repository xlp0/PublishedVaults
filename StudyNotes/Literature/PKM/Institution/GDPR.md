[[GDPR]] stands for [[GDPR|General Data Protection Regulation]]. It is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that governs the privacy and protection of personal data of individuals within the EU. GDPR was implemented on May 25, 2018, and it applies to all organizations, both inside and outside the EU, that process personal data of EU residents.

The main purpose of GDPR is to give individuals more control over their personal data and to ensure that organizations handle this data responsibly. It sets out specific guidelines and requirements for how personal data should be collected, processed, stored, and protected by organizations. GDPR also grants individuals certain rights, such as the right to access their personal data, the right to request its deletion, and the right to know how their data is being used.

Organizations that fail to comply with GDPR can face significant fines and penalties. The regulation has had a global impact on businesses as many companies worldwide have had to adapt their policies and practices to meet GDPR requirements if they handle personal data of EU residents.
