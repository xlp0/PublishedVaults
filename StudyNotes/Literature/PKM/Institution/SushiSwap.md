Aliases: SushiSwap

SushiSwap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange ([[DEX]]) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a fork of the popular decentralized exchange Uniswap and was launched in August 2020. SushiSwap aims to provide users with a more community-driven and rewarding platform for trading cryptocurrencies.

One of the key features of SushiSwap is its use of automated market-making ([[AMM]]), which allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries. Users can also provide liquidity to the platform by depositing their tokens into liquidity pools, and in return, they receive SUSHI tokens as rewards.

SUSHI is the native token of SushiSwap and plays a vital role in the platform's governance and incentive mechanism. Holders of SUSHI can participate in voting on various proposals and decisions related to the platform's development and operation.

SushiSwap gained attention due to its unique "vampire attack" strategy, where it incentivized users to migrate their funds from Uniswap by offering higher rewards. This approach sparked a debate within the [[DeFi|decentralized finance]] ([[DeFi]]) community but also led to increased popularity and usage of SushiSwap.

Overall, SushiSwap aims to provide users with a decentralized and community-driven alternative to traditional centralized exchanges, allowing them to trade cryptocurrencies securely while earning rewards through liquidity provision.
