The [[AADC|Age-Appropriate Design Code]], also known as the [[AADC|Children's Code]], is a set of regulations introduced by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to ensure that online services are designed with the best interests of children in mind and to protect their privacy and safety.

The code applies to any online service or platform that is likely to be accessed by children under the age of 18. This includes websites, apps, social media platforms, search engines, online games, and more. It covers a wide range of requirements that companies must adhere to when designing and developing their services.

Some key principles of the [[AADC|Age Appropriate Design Code]] include:

1. Best Interests of the Child: The code emphasizes that companies should prioritize the best interests of children when designing their services. This involves considering factors such as their age range, evolving capacities, and specific needs.

2. Data Minimization: Companies should limit the amount of personal data they collect from children and should only collect data that is necessary for providing their services. They should also ensure that any data collected is securely stored and protected.

3. Age-Appropriate Privacy Settings: Online services must provide default privacy settings that offer a high level of privacy to children by default. Companies should give them control over their privacy settings and make it easy for them to understand and change these settings.

4. Transparency: Companies need to provide clear information about how they collect, use, and share personal data with children. This information should be presented in a manner that is easily understandable for different age groups.

5. Profiling: The code restricts companies from using personal data to make decisions or create profiles about children for marketing or other purposes without proper safeguards in place.

6. Nudge Techniques: Online services should not employ techniques that are designed to exploit children's vulnerability or encourage them to provide unnecessary personal data or engage in harmful activities.

7. High Privacy Settings by Default: The code requires companies to set privacy settings to their highest level by default for under-18 users, unless there is a compelling reason not to.

The Age Appropriate Design Code came into effect on September 2, 2020. It provides a set of guidelines and standards that companies must follow to ensure the safety and privacy of children online. Failure to comply with the code can result in enforcement actions and significant penalties for non-compliant organizations.

## How is Age Appropriate Design Code related to GDPR

The Age Appropriate Design Code, also known as the Children's Code, is a set of guidelines developed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK. It aims to protect the privacy and online safety of children under the age of 18 by setting standards for online services that are likely to be accessed by children.

The [[GDPR]] ([[GDPR|General Data Protection Regulation]]) is a data protection law that applies to all individuals in the European Union (EU) and regulates the processing of personal data. It provides individuals with greater control over their personal data and places obligations on organizations that collect and process personal data.

The Age Appropriate Design Code is related to [[GDPR]] because it aligns with the principles and requirements outlined in GDPR regarding the processing of personal data, including that of children. The code emphasizes the need for websites and online services to implement measures such as age verification, privacy settings, parental controls, and clear information about data processing practices.

The GDPR recognizes children as a vulnerable group when it comes to personal data processing. It requires organizations to obtain parental consent for processing children's personal data under certain circumstances. The Age Appropriate Design Code helps organizations comply with these requirements by providing specific guidance on how to design their online services in a way that protects children's privacy rights.

Overall, while GDPR provides a legal framework for data protection, the Age Appropriate Design Code complements it by providing practical guidance on implementing appropriate measures specifically tailored for protecting children's privacy online.
