The [[FSF|Free Software Foundation]] ([[FSF]]) is a non-profit organization founded in 1985 by [[Richard Stallman]]. Its primary mission is to promote and defend the principles of software freedom. The FSF believes that all computer users should have the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software.

One of the key initiatives of the FSF is the promotion of free software licenses, most notably the [[GNU]] General Public License (GPL). The GPL ensures that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software. It has been widely adopted by many open-source projects.

The FSF also develops and maintains a wide range of free software projects under the GNU Project. These include popular tools like the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Emacs text editor, and other essential components for building a complete free operating system.

Another important aspect of the FSF's work is advocating for user freedoms and raising awareness about issues related to proprietary software and digital rights. They campaign against software patents, digital restrictions management (DRM), and advocate for privacy rights in relation to technology.

The organization relies on individual donations and contributions from supporters to carry out its activities. It also coordinates with like-minded organizations around the world in promoting free software principles.

Overall, the Free Software Foundation plays a crucial role in advocating for software freedom and ensuring that users have control over their computing devices through its support for free software licenses, development of essential tools, and advocacy efforts.
