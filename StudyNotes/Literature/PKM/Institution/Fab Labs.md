Fab Lab, short for "Fabrication Laboratory," is a network of digital fabrication facilities that provide access to modern tools and technologies for creating, prototyping, and manufacturing various products. The concept of Fab Lab was first introduced by [[Neil Gershenfeld]], a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 2005.

Fab Labs typically consist of an array of computer-controlled machines such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC routers, milling machines, and other tools for electronics assembly. These labs also offer a wide range of software and hardware resources that enable users to design and fabricate their ideas.

The primary goal of Fab Labs is to democratize access to advanced manufacturing technologies. They aim to empower individuals from diverse backgrounds including students, entrepreneurs, artists, and community members to bring their ideas to life. Fab Labs provide an open and collaborative environment where people can learn from each other, share knowledge and skills, collaborate on projects, and explore new possibilities in digital fabrication.

Besides providing access to equipment and software, Fab Labs often offer educational programs and workshops. These programs help individuals develop the necessary skills in design thinking, CAD (Computer-Aided Design), electronics prototyping, programming microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi boards, and more. This emphasis on education ensures that anyone can participate in the process of creating physical objects using digital tools.

Fab Labs have gained popularity worldwide with hundreds of labs established in various countries. They have become hubs for innovation and creativity by fostering a culture of experimentation and collaboration. The global network enables individuals within the Fab Lab community to connect with each other across borders, exchange ideas and knowledge, and collectively work towards solving complex problems.

Overall, Fab Labs serve as accessible spaces for digital fabrication that promote hands-on learning experiences while enabling individuals to turn their ideas into reality using advanced technologies.
