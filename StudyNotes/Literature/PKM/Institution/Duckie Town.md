The Duckie Town program at MIT CSAIL (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) is an educational initiative that focuses on teaching autonomous driving and robotics using small-scale vehicles called "[[Duckiebot|Duckiebots]]." The program aims to provide students with a hands-on experience in building, testing, and deploying self-driving cars in an accessible and affordable manner. The platform has gained popularity within the research community due to its simplicity, affordability, and reproducibility. It enables researchers worldwide to collaborate on developing robust algorithms that can handle complex urban driving scenarios.

The Duckie Town program uses a simulated urban environment called "Duckietown" where Duckiebots navigate roads, intersections, traffic signs, and other obstacles. The Duckiebots are equipped with cameras, sensors, and onboard computers that allow them to perceive their surroundings and make decisions based on the data they collect.

The program is designed to be interdisciplinary, involving students from various backgrounds such as computer science, engineering, robotics, and [[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI|artificial intelligence]]. It encourages collaborative learning through team-based projects where participants can apply their knowledge in areas like perception, control systems, planning algorithms, machine learning, and more.

Additionally, the Duckie Town program provides [[OSS|open-source software]] frameworks and resources for building and programming Duckiebots. This allows participants to customize their robots' behavior or develop new algorithms for autonomy. The community-driven nature of the program fosters innovation and encourages contributions from students worldwide.

The educational benefits of the Duckie Town program include gaining practical skills in robotics and autonomous systems development while working on real-world challenges. It also provides a platform for exploring cutting-edge research areas related to self-driving cars and urban mobility.

In summary, the Duckie Town program at MIT CSAIL offers an engaging and accessible way for students to learn about autonomous driving through hands-on projects with Duckiebots in a simulated urban environment.

## How does Duckie town relate to ETH the university, and Prof. Frazolli?

Duckie town is a miniature city designed to test autonomous vehicles and teach [[Robotics|robitics]] concepts. It was created as a project by students at ETH Zurich, a leading Swiss university known for its research and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[STEM]]) fields.

Prof. [[Emilio Frazzoli]] is a professor at ETH Zurich and is one of the key figures behind the development of Duckie town. He has been involved in research related to autonomous systems, robotics, and transportation planning. Prof. Frazzoli's expertise and guidance have been instrumental in shaping the vision and implementation of Duckie town.

Therefore, Duckie town is directly related to ETH Zurich as it originated from student projects at the university. Additionally, Prof. Frazzoli's involvement further strengthens the connection between Duckie town and ETH Zurich.
