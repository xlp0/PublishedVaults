**ChatGPT** (**Chat** **Generative Pre-Trained Transformer**) is an [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot "Chatbot") developed by [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI") and launched on November 30, 2022. It is notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language used. Successive prompts and replies are taken into account at each stage of the conversation as a context. While its content spans various domains of knowledge,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-guardianpos-2) ChatGPT has displayed a [tendency to confidently provide inaccurate information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)#ChatGPT "Hallucination (artificial intelligence)").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-TheVergeStackOverflow-3)

## Example

Please show me a React.js component for printing Hello World

Sure! Here's an example of a React.js component that prints "Hello World":

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
  }
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

To use this component, you can import it into another file and render it in your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Make sure to have a root element with the id "root" in your HTML file where the component will be rendered.
