Micro payment refers to a small financial transaction conducted online, typically involving a minimal amount of money. It allows individuals to make small purchases or payments for digital goods and services that are not viable for traditional payment methods due to their low value. Micro payments are commonly used for purchasing digital content such as e-books, music downloads, online articles, games, or mobile apps. The convenience and affordability of micro payments have led to their popularity in various industries, including media, gaming, and software development.
