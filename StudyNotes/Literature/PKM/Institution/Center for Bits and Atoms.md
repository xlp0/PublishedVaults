The Center for Bits and Atoms ([[Center for Bits and Atoms|CBA]]) is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was founded in 2001 by [[Neil Gershenfeld]], who is also the director of the lab. The primary focus of the CBA is on exploring the relationship between digital information and physical matter.

The CBA aims to bridge the gap between computer science, engineering, and various other fields such as biology, materials science, physics, and design. It brings together researchers from diverse backgrounds to work on projects that involve designing and building innovative technologies.

One of the core philosophies of the CBA is "making almost anything." The lab emphasizes democratizing access to technology by developing tools and processes that enable people to create their own customized solutions. This approach is often referred to as "digital fabrication" or "personal fabrication."

The CBA has developed several groundbreaking technologies over the years, including Fab Labs (fabrication laboratories), which are small-scale workshops equipped with digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, and milling machines. These Fab Labs have been established in various locations worldwide, providing individuals with access to advanced manufacturing capabilities.

Additionally, the CBA has worked on projects related to synthetic biology, nanotechnology, programmable matter, smart materials, wearable technology, robotics, and more. Its research often explores new ways of merging computation with physical objects to create novel functionalities.

The Center for Bits and Atoms encourages a hands-on approach to learning and research. It promotes collaboration between students, faculty members, industry partners, and individuals from diverse communities. Through its activities and initiatives, it strives to push boundaries in technology development while fostering a culture of creativity and innovation.
