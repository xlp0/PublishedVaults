[[NASA]], which stands for the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], is an independent agency of the United States federal government. It was established in 1958 and is responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for conducting research in space exploration, aeronautics, and related fields.

NASA's primary goal is to pioneer the future of space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research. The agency has achieved numerous significant milestones throughout its history. One of its most notable accomplishments was the [[Apollo program]], which successfully landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969.

NASA operates various centers across the United States that conduct research and development activities. Some of its major centers include the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Johnson Space Center in Texas, Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, and Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

The agency has been involved in launching numerous satellites and spacecraft into space to study Earth's atmosphere, climate change, planets within our solar system, outer space phenomena, and deep space exploration. Examples of NASA missions include the Hubble Space Telescope, Mars rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), Voyager probes exploring beyond our solar system, the International Space Station (ISS), and ongoing missions to explore other planets such as Jupiter (Juno) and Saturn (Cassini).

In addition to scientific exploration, NASA also conducts a variety of programs aimed at inspiring future generations to pursue careers in [[STEM|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] ([[STEM]]). These programs include internships for students, educational initiatives for K-12 students and teachers, as well as public outreach events.

Overall, NASA plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of space and Earth while pushing technological boundaries to enable human exploration beyond our planet.
