#HDX

The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is an initiative of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It is a platform that aims to provide open access to humanitarian data and promote data sharing among organizations and individuals involved in humanitarian response and coordination efforts.

HDX was launched in 2014 with the goal of improving the availability and accessibility of data in emergency situations. It allows organizations to share their data, including datasets, maps, and visualizations, on a centralized platform. This facilitates collaboration, analysis, and decision-making by making information readily available to those working in humanitarian contexts.

The platform hosts a wide range of datasets related to various aspects of humanitarian response, such as population statistics, health services, water sources, infrastructure, and more. It also provides tools for data visualization and analysis to enable users to better understand the context and make informed decisions.

HDX encourages its users to contribute their own data by providing guidelines on data standards and formats. The platform also promotes the use of open data principles to ensure transparency and accountability in humanitarian operations.

In addition to serving as a repository for humanitarian data, HDX also supports initiatives like Data Fellows Program and Data Partnerships. These programs aim to build capacity within organizations involved in humanitarian work by providing training and support on data management, analysis, and visualization.

Overall, HDX plays a vital role in improving coordination among humanitarian actors by promoting the sharing of reliable and up-to-date information. By facilitating access to critical data during emergencies or crises, it contributes towards more effective planning, response efforts, and ultimately helps save lives.
