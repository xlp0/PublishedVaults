[[Balancer]] is an automated market maker ([[AMM]]) protocol built on the [[Ethereum]] blockchain. It allows users to create and manage liquidity pools with multiple tokens rather than just a pair of tokens like most other AMMs. Balancer enables users to set their desired weights for each token in the pool, allowing for customizable asset allocations.

Balancer operates on the principle of constant mean market making, where the total value of all tokens in a pool remains constant. This means that when one token's price increases, its weight in the pool decreases, and vice versa. This mechanism encourages arbitrageurs to buy undervalued tokens and sell overvalued tokens, thereby bringing the prices back to equilibrium.

The protocol also includes features such as smart order routing and dynamic fees. Smart order routing helps users get the best possible trade execution by splitting their orders across multiple pools if needed. Dynamic fees allow liquidity providers to earn higher fees when their assets are in high demand and lower fees when there is less demand.

Overall, Balancer provides a flexible and efficient way for users to create self-balancing portfolios of multiple tokens while ensuring liquidity and enabling efficient trading within those pools.
