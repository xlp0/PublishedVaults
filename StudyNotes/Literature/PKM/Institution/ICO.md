The primary role of the ICO is to protect individuals' personal data by regulating how organizations collect, use, store, and share it.

It also promotes transparency and accountability in data processing activities.

Some key functions of the ICO include:

5. Registration: Organizations that process personal data are generally required to register with the ICO unless they fall under certain exemptions. This registration provides transparency about who is processing personal data for what purposes.
