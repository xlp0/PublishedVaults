Project Xanadu is a pioneering computer project started in 1960 by [[Ted Nelson]], an American philosopher and computer scientist. It aims to create a global network of interconnected documents, where users can easily link and access information across multiple sources. The project's name is inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "Kubla Khan," which describes a mythical place called Xanadu.

The main idea behind Project Xanadu is to establish a two-way linking system, allowing users to link not only from one document to another but also back to the original source. This concept, known as "transclusion," allows for more accurate citation and proper attribution of information. In addition, transclusion enables users to view and edit documents simultaneously without creating multiple copies or versions.

Over the years, Project Xanadu has faced numerous challenges and delays due to technical complexities, funding issues, and evolving technologies. Despite these setbacks, it has significantly influenced the development of [[Hypertext|hypertext]] systems and web technologies.

One of the notable features envisioned in Project Xanadu is the ability to charge micropayments for accessing copyrighted content. Nelson proposed a model where authors would be compensated directly for every quote or reference made from their works. This idea aimed to address copyright concerns while promoting fair usage and rewarding content creators.

While Project Xanadu has not been fully realized on a global scale as originally envisioned, some of its concepts have been implemented in various forms. For example, hypertext systems like HyperCard and Hyperlink have incorporated some aspects of transclusion into their design.

Despite its ongoing development challenges, Project Xanadu remains an influential project that has sparked discussions about intellectual property rights, information sharing, and the future of digital publishing. It serves as a testament to Ted Nelson's vision for interconnected knowledge systems that prioritize accuracy, attribution, and collaboration.
