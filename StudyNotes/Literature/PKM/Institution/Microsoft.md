Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, and related services. It was founded by [[Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen in 1975 and has since become one of the largest and most influential technology companies in the world.

Microsoft acquired [[GitHub]] in June 2018 for $7.5 billion. GitHub is a popular web-based platform used by developers to host and manage version control repositories for their software projects. It allows developers to collaborate on code, track changes, and manage project workflows efficiently.

With the acquisition of [[GitHub]], Microsoft aimed to strengthen its position in the developer community and expand its offerings for software developers. Since then, Microsoft has been actively integrating GitHub into its suite of developer tools and services. This integration includes seamless workflows between Visual Studio (Microsoft's integrated development environment) and GitHub repositories, as well as deep integration with Azure (Microsoft's cloud computing platform).

Regarding [[ChatGPT]] (formerly known as GPT-3), it is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text based on prompts given to it. While ChatGPT is not directly related to Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub, it has gained attention as an advanced AI model that can be used for various purposes including natural language understanding and generation.

While Microsoft has not specifically acquired or developed ChatGPT itself, OpenAI (the organization behind ChatGPT) has collaborated with Microsoft on several AI initiatives. For instance, OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as its preferred cloud provider in 2019 to support large-scale AI workloads. This collaboration indicates a shared interest in advancing artificial intelligence technologies.

In summary, Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub strengthens its developer-focused offerings while also collaborating with organizations like OpenAI highlights their commitment to advancing AI technologies like ChatGPT.
