The National Security Agency ([[NSA]]) is a United States intelligence agency responsible for the collection, processing, and analysis of foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) and also protecting U.S. communication systems and information from foreign adversaries. It was established in 1952 as a successor to the Armed Forces Security Agency.

The NSA operates under the [[DoD|Department of Defense]]([[DoD]]) and is headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland. Its primary mission is to gather intelligence through electronic surveillance and code-breaking techniques to support national security and foreign policy objectives. The agency conducts global monitoring of various communications such as phone calls, emails, internet traffic, and satellite transmissions.

The NSA's activities have been controversial due to concerns about privacy invasion and potential abuse of power. In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified documents that revealed extensive surveillance programs operated by the agency. These revelations sparked a global debate about surveillance practices and privacy rights.

In addition to its surveillance role, the NSA also plays a crucial role in information assurance by protecting national security systems and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. It develops advanced encryption technologies, conducts cybersecurity operations, and collaborates with other government agencies, private sector entities, and international partners to safeguard information networks.

The director of the NSA is appointed by the President of the United States with Senate confirmation. The agency operates under strict oversight by Congress through various committees responsible for ensuring its activities comply with legal requirements and respect civil liberties.

Overall, the National Security Agency is an integral part of U.S. intelligence efforts aimed at collecting foreign signals intelligence while simultaneously defending American communication systems from external threats.
