What is Robotics

[[Robotics]] is a branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. It involves the study of computer systems, mechanical systems, electrical systems, and [[AI|artificial intelligence]] to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robots are typically programmed to perform specific functions or tasks, and they can range from simple machines that perform repetitive actions to advanced humanoid robots capable of complex interactions with humans and their environment. Robotics finds applications in various fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, space exploration, military operations, and more.
