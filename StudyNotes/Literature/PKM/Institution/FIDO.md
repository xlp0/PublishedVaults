Aliases: FIDO, Fast Identity Online
---

[[FIDO]] is an acronym for [[FIDO|Fast Identity Online]], and it refers to a set of open standards and specifications developed by the FIDO Alliance. The FIDO Alliance is a global consortium of technology companies, including major players like Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Samsung, and many others.

The primary goal of the FIDO Alliance is to provide simpler and stronger authentication methods that enhance online security while improving user experience. Traditional username/password combinations often fall short in terms of security and can be inconvenient for users. FIDO aims to address these issues by promoting the adoption of passwordless authentication technologies.

FIDO standardizes the implementation of strong authentication methods such as biometrics (like fingerprints or facial recognition) and public key cryptography. By leveraging these technologies, FIDO enables secure and convenient authentication across various devices and platforms.

The FIDO specifications include two main components:

1. Universal Authentication Framework (UAF): This specification allows users to authenticate using biometrics or other local authentication methods supported by their devices. It eliminates the need for passwords by securely authenticating users through unique identifiers stored locally on their devices.

2. Universal Second Factor (U2F): This specification adds a second layer of security to existing username/password logins. U2F enables hardware-based security keys (USB or NFC devices) that can be used as a second factor during authentication. These keys provide stronger protection against phishing attacks compared to traditional SMS-based two-factor authentication.

Overall, FIDO's goal is to establish open standards that enable interoperability between various devices and services while ensuring better security practices for user authentication in the digital world.
