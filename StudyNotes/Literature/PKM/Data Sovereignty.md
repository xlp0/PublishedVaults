Data sovereignty ([[數據主權]]) refers to the legal concept that [[Data|data]] is subject to the laws and governance of the country in which it is located. It encompasses the idea that data generated by individuals or organizations within a specific country should be subject to the jurisdiction and protection of that country's laws, rather than being stored or processed in other countries.

Data sovereignty has become increasingly important in the digital age as data flows across borders and is stored in various locations around the world. It raises concerns regarding privacy, security, and control over personal information. Governments are particularly concerned about protecting sensitive national data, intellectual property, and ensuring compliance with their own regulations.

The concept of data sovereignty has implications for businesses as well. Many countries have enacted laws requiring certain types of data to be stored locally or restricting its transfer outside of national borders. This can impact multinational companies that operate globally and rely on cloud computing or data processing services located in other countries.

Data sovereignty also intersects with issues such as surveillance, government access to data, and international cooperation on law enforcement matters. Balancing individual privacy rights with national security interests can be challenging, leading to debates and discussions on how to effectively manage and regulate cross-border data flows.

In summary, data sovereignty refers to the idea that countries have jurisdiction over the data generated within their borders. It involves legal considerations related to privacy, security, cross-border transfers, and compliance with local regulations. The concept has gained prominence due to increasing digitization and global connectivity, raising important questions about control and protection of personal information in a globalized world.
