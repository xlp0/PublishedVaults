Aliases: SOTA, State of the Art
---

[[SOTA]] is an acronym that stands for "[[State of the Art]]." It refers to the highest level of development or achievement in a particular field at a given time. The term is commonly used in various industries and domains, including technology, science, art, and research.

The concept of state of the art emerged in the early 20th century, primarily in the field of engineering. It was used to describe the highest level of technological advancement achieved at a specific time. Over the years, the term has evolved and expanded its usage to encompass other disciplines.

In academia and research communities, SOTA often refers to the most advanced techniques, methodologies, or models being employed in a specific domain. It represents the current benchmark against which new ideas or innovations are measured. SOTA is crucial for understanding progress within a field and for determining areas that require further exploration.

In technology-driven fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), SOTA is particularly significant. Researchers often publish papers detailing their novel approaches or algorithms that outperform previous methods on certain tasks or datasets. These papers present their findings by comparing their models' performance with existing benchmarks and highlighting how they have achieved a new state of the art. 

The term SOTA has become widespread due to its importance in assessing advancements and facilitating collaboration among researchers. It helps establish common ground for discussing advancements and enables researchers to build upon existing knowledge effectively.
# Dynamically Approximate SOTA
For instance, [[Tool-LLM]] ([[@qinToolLLMFacilitatingLarge2023|see paper]]) is an approach to approximate [[SOTA]] technologies based on late-breaking solutions on the Internet. By having computing resources and late-breaking data continuously made available on the Internet, [[Tool-LLM]]-like technologies can tap into this dynamically updated resources on an Internet scale to approximate [[SOTA]].

## Connection with Correctness
Since the notion of "[[Correctness]]"" in computing science is almost always approximated in localized context under [[Abstract Interpretation|interpretation]], [[SOTA]] as an approximated concept is useful because it can help define the quality of solution based on "best" or "latest" efforts. 

# Conclusion

In summary, [[SOTA]] (State of the Art) represents the highest level of development or achievement within a specific field at a given time. It originated in engineering but has since expanded its usage across various domains as a way to measure progress and innovation.
