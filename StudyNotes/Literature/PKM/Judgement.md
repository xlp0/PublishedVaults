On [[2023-08-21|August 21, 2023]], [[Ray Dougherty]] gave a talk titled: "Evaluating the Stregnth of 'data based' argument. He explicitly mentioned some key persons and references:

1. [[Noam Chomsky]]
2. [[Claude Shannon]]
3. [[Blaise Pascal]]
4. [[Antoine Arnauld]]
5. [[René Descartes]]

In the lecture, the [Pascal Problem](app://obsidian.md/Pascal%20Problem) ([[Pascal Problem|Problem of Points]])was mentioned. The probabilistic nature of this problem is directly related to the uncertain outcomes as prescribed in the game theoretic framing presented in the [[Curse of Knowledge]]. [[Information asymmetry]] is not guaranteed to always favor the party that has more knowledge about the overall situation.
