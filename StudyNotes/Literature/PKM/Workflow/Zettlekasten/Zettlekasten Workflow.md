#Zettlekasten

[[Zettlekasten]] is a note-taking and [[Personal Knowledge Management|knowledge management]] system developed by German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]]. The Zettlekasten workflow is a method of organizing and connecting notes to facilitate the generation of new ideas and insights. Moreover, it is a way to demonstrate human intentions and therefore enables the notion of [[Intentional Workflow|intentional workflow]].

The core principle of the Zettlekasten workflow is the idea that knowledge is created through the connection and synthesis of existing information. In this system, notes are taken on individual ideas or concepts, which are then linked together in a network of interconnected thoughts. This allows for the emergence of new connections and insights as more notes are added to the system. It may also help improve system [[Correctness|correctness]] by being more [[Intentional Workflow|intentional]] across the entire thinking and doing process.

Here are some key aspects of the Zettlekasten workflow:

1. Atomic Notes: Notes in the Zettlekasten system are kept short and focused on a single idea or concept. This helps in creating a granular structure that can be easily linked with other related notes.

2. Unique Identifiers: Each note is assigned a unique identifier, such as a number or keyword, which allows for easy referencing and linking between different notes.

3. Linking: The heart of the Zettlekasten workflow lies in creating links between related notes. When new ideas or connections emerge, they can be linked to existing notes using their unique identifiers. This creates a web-like structure where different ideas are interconnected.

4. Progressive Summarization: Notes can be continually refined and expanded upon over time as new insights or connections are discovered. This process, known as progressive summarization, helps in deepening understanding and refining ideas.

5. Retrieval: The Zettlekasten system emphasizes easy retrieval of information through effective tagging, search functionality, and well-organized note structures. This allows for quick access to relevant information when needed.

The Zettlekasten workflow provides a framework for capturing ideas, fostering creativity, and generating new knowledge by encouraging active engagement with one's own thinking process. It has gained popularity among researchers, writers, and knowledge workers looking for an effective way to manage and leverage their accumulated knowledge.
