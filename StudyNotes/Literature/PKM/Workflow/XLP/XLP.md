Extreme Learning ProcessÂ ([XLP](https://pkc.pub/wiki/XLP "XLP")) is a pedagogy that is focused on student-centered learning and is based on the idea that students can learn and achieve more when they are actively engaged in the learning process. It emphasizes the fact that students should be responsible for their own learning and that the teacher's role is to facilitate and guide the learning process. The notion of [[DevOps]] significantly influences the implementation and evolution of [[XLP]]. It would be ideal to use [[PKC]] as an instrument to streamline the practice of [[XLP]]. It emphasizes the adoption of formalized [[Correctness|correctness]] verification process, by requiring students to capture realistic and life [[Data|data]], while writing [[Smart Contract|smart contract]] and [[Constitution|constitution]] in the learning process. It maybe considered to be a kind of [[Gamification|gamification]] of learning. It is compatible with the educational goals of [[STEM]], and is being co-developed with [[GASing]] method.

The key principles of XLP include:

- Self-directed learning: students take ownership of their own learning process and are responsible for setting their own learning goals.

- Experiential learning: students learn by doing and actively engaging in hands-on experiences.

- Collaborative learning: students work together in small groups to complete projects and share their knowledge and experiences.

- Reflection: students reflect on their learning process and evaluate their own progress.

- Personalization: instruction is tailored to the individual needs and interests of each student.

XLP is based on the idea that students learn best when they are actively engaged in the learning process and when they are given the opportunity to take ownership of their own learning. It seeks to create a dynamic and interactive learning environment that is responsive to the needs and interests of each individual student.

It has been reported that XLP has been applied to various subjects and levels of education, and it's been shown to improve student engagement, motivation, and achievement. It also has been used in various settings such as classrooms, online learning, and blended learning environments.

## Overall View
XLP is a methodology for crowd learning, meaning that it considers the learning activities that take place in many temporal and spatial scales.

## The Logic of Logic Model
[[XLP]] is a process based on [[Logic Model]]. 

## Process

There are four stages of the learning process, which matches to the four stages of [[Zettlekasten Workflow]].

1. [[Early Success]]
2. [[Fail Early Fail Safe]]
3. [[Convergence]]
4. [[Demonstration]]
These four stages relates to the notion of [[Zettlekasten]] emphasize that all data elements should be filed into [[Fleeting|fleeting]] directory, that means any data that deemed to be useful can be shuffled into the [[Fleeting]] bin, and then, checked with knowledge content in the [[Literature]] directory, then, put into the [[Hub]] directory for convergence, and then, put into [[Permanent]] directory for public demonstration. Iterative organizing content in this four-stage structure helps reduce the complexity in the process of learning, and therefore, enable individuals and teams to synchronize their actions more quickly. The style of student-oriented learning process is compatible with Prof. [[Yohanes Surya|Yohanes Surya's]] [[GASing]].




## The Three-Tiered Content Structure
XLP organizes content knowledge into three layers, they are [[Cognitive Foundation]], [[Computational Thinking]], and [[Systems Thinking]].

## Related Work
[[GASing]] Method developed by Professor Yohanes Surya is a framework that is compatible with [[XLP]].

[[Network Publishing Paradigm]] (NPP), also developed by [[Hsueh-Yung Benjamin Koo|Dr. Koo]], was precursor to [[XLP]].
