Early success maps to the [[Fleeting]] directory in the [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]. Followed by [[Fail Early Fail Safe]].

## Ideas from Zettlekasten Workflow
In the beginning of any learning process, it is necessary to draw in all kinds of contextualized data as possible. Therefore, it is possible to include a significant amount of redundant, and potentially unnecessary data. That could be all temporally and automatically sorted to the [[Unfiled Items]] in [[Zotero]] and they are just considered to be the [[Fleeting]] folder. To make participants feel engaged, this inclusive policy to admit data is considered to be admissible to the [[Early Success]] stage in [[XLP]].
