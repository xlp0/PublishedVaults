#XLP 

[[Convergence]] is the process of identifying content that is also available, so that repetition can converge to a singular node, therefore improving efficiency. The data content being managed in this process stage should converge with existing [[Literature|literature]]. In [[Zoterp]] this type of reference data content is intentionally stored in the [[My Library]] folder, separated from the [[My Publication]] folder. The [[My Publication]] is reserved for the next stage, which is [[Demonstration]]. In [[Obsidian]], we encourage the published data to be located in the top-level [[Permanent]] directory, as the word: "**permanent**" is reserved in the [[Zettlekasten Workflow]].

## Namespace Management
A key idea in [[XLP]]'s  stage of [[Convergence]] is to make sure that names are preserved for their proper uses. This is why it is called [[Convergence]]. This maps to the [[Literature]] folder idea in [[Zettlekasten]], and [[My Library]] in [[Zotero]].
