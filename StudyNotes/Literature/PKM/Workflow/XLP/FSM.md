ALiases: FSM, Free Software Movement

The Free Software Movement is a social movement that advocates for the freedom to use, study, distribute, and modify software. It was started by [[Richard Stallman]] in the 1980s with the goal of promoting software freedom and resisting the growing restrictions on computer users.

At the heart of the Free Software Movement is the concept of "free software," which does not refer to price but rather to freedom. Free software gives users certain essential freedoms: the freedom to run the program for any purpose, to study how it works and modify it according to their needs, to redistribute copies, and to distribute modified versions.

The movement believes that proprietary software restricts users' freedoms by imposing limitations on what they can do with it. Proprietary software often comes with restrictive licenses that prevent users from examining or modifying its source code, leading to a lack of transparency and control over their own computing devices.

The Free Software Movement promotes the use of free software licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), which ensures that users have these essential freedoms. These licenses allow anyone to use, modify, and distribute free software while also preserving these freedoms for future users.

One of the most significant projects initiated by the Free Software Movement is the GNU Project. The GNU Project aims to develop a complete operating system composed entirely of free software. Although it is still under development, many components of this operating system are widely used today in combination with other free software projects like Linux.

The Free Software Movement has had a profound impact on modern technology and society as a whole. It has fostered collaboration, sharing of knowledge, and innovation within the software community. It has also influenced other related movements like open-source software and open culture.

Overall, the Free Software Movement strives for a world where people have full control over their digital lives and can exercise their fundamental rights when it comes to using and modifying computer programs.
