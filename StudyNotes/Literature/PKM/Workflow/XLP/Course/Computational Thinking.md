[Computational Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computational_thinking&oldid=1157332632) refers to a way of solving problems and designing systems that draw on concepts fundamental to computer science. It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and using algorithmic thinking to devise step-by-step solutions.

## Wing's Summary of Computational Thinking

Wing emphasizes that Computational Thinking is not limited to computer scientists only; it is a skill that can be applied by anyone in any field. It involves three key components:

1. Conceptualizing: This involves formulating a problem in a way that can be tackled computationally. It includes understanding the problem domain, identifying relevant data and variables, and defining the goals and constraints of the problem.

2. Logically organizing and analyzing data: Computational Thinking requires the ability to organize and structure information effectively. This may involve techniques such as sorting, searching, filtering, or summarizing data to gain insights or identify patterns.

3. Designing algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. Computational Thinking involves creating algorithms that are efficient, scalable, and accurate in order to solve problems effectively.

Wing argues that Computational Thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone in today's technology-driven world. It helps individuals approach complex problems with a systematic mindset and enables them to leverage technology to find innovative solutions.

By promoting Computational Thinking, Wing aims to equip individuals with skills beyond coding or programming but rather with problem-solving abilities that can be applied across various domains.
