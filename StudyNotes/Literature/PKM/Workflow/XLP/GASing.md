The GASing method, also known as the Genius Approach to Solving Problems, was invented by Prof. [[Yohanes Surya]]. Prof. Surya is an Indonesian mathematician and educator known for his innovative teaching methods.

The GASing method is designed to enhance problem-solving skills and encourage creative thinking among students. It aims to develop a student's ability to analyze problems, think critically, and generate creative solutions. It is compatible with the educational goals of [[STEM]].

GASing stands for Gagasan Aneka Solusi dalam Menghadapi Soal (Idea of Various Solutions in Facing Problems). The method encourages students to come up with as many solutions as possible for a given problem. It emphasizes the idea that there are multiple ways to approach and solve any problem.

The GASing method involves several steps:

1. Understanding the problem: Students begin by thoroughly understanding the problem statement or question.

2. Generating ideas: Students brainstorm as many different ideas or solutions as possible without worrying about their feasibility or [[Correctness|correctness]].

3. Organizing ideas: Students then organize their generated ideas into categories or groups based on similarities or patterns.

4. Analyzing ideas: The next step involves evaluating each idea's strengths, weaknesses, and potential outcomes. This analysis helps students identify which solutions are viable and worth pursuing further.

5. Selecting the best solution: After analyzing all the generated ideas, students select the most appropriate solution based on their evaluation criteria.

6. Implementing and evaluating: The final step involves implementing the chosen solution and evaluating its effectiveness in solving the problem.

The GASing method aims to foster a growth mindset among students by encouraging them to explore various approaches instead of being fixated on finding a single correct answer. It promotes creative thinking, collaboration, and adaptability in problem-solving situations. It also emphasizes the notion of [[Symmetry]] in all aspects of the teaching, including both physical and social aspects of information symmetry. It also promotes the notion of using  [[Intentional Workflow]] to help students and teachers as a whole community to converge and [[Emergence|emerge]] as a more coherent learning organization. It encourages students and teachers to discover their own ways to approach [[Correctness|correct]] results and reasoning methods. It may also be considered as a large-scale implementation of [[Gamification|gamification]] of mathematical and science learning. In summary, [[GASing]] method is a [[Radical Novelty|radically novel]] way of learning at scale.

## Recent Developments
Recently, [[GASing]] is systematically incorporate many other areas of learning programs and educational initiatives. It is being expanded by incorporating other pragmatic skills and tools, such as [[EuMuse]] for arts and music appreciation, [[Duwi Arsana|electronics/ mechanical design]], and [[Computational Thinking]] as part of its integral curriculum 


Prof. Yohanes Surya has conducted numerous workshops and training sessions worldwide to introduce teachers and educators to the GASing method. His goal is to revolutionize mathematics education by promoting problem-solving skills and inspiring students to think outside the box.
