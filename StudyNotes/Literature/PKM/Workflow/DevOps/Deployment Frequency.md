[[Deployment Frequency|Deployment frequency]] is a key metric used in DevOps research and assessment to measure the speed and frequency at which software changes are deployed into production. It is an important aspect of continuous delivery and continuous deployment practices.

In DevOps, the goal is to have a fast and efficient software delivery pipeline, where changes can be deployed quickly and frequently. Deployment frequency is a measure of how often these changes are pushed into production.

DevOps research and assessment methodologies often use deployment frequency as an indicator of an organization's ability to deliver software rapidly. Higher deployment frequencies indicate that an organization has implemented efficient development practices, automated testing, and deployment processes.

Measuring deployment frequency allows organizations to track their progress towards achieving DevOps goals such as increased agility, faster time-to-market, and improved customer satisfaction. It also helps identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement in the software delivery pipeline.

For example, one could measure the [[Deployment Frequency|deployment frequency]] of a knowledge worker by how many [[Permanent]] notes one produces per day.

To measure deployment frequency, organizations typically track the number of deployments made within a specific time period, such as daily or weekly. This metric provides insights into how frequently new features, bug fixes, or enhancements are being released to end-users.

Organizations can use this data to set performance targets and compare their deployment frequency with industry benchmarks or competitors. It can also be used as a basis for evaluating process improvements or assessing the impact of changes made to the development workflow.

In summary, deployment frequency is an essential metric in DevOps research and assessment that helps organizations gauge their ability to rapidly deliver software changes into production. It provides valuable insights into the efficiency of development practices and aids in identifying areas for improvement in the software delivery pipeline.
