In [[DORA]] (DevOps Research and Assessment) terms, [[Change Failure Rate]] ([[Change Failure Rate|CFR]]) is a metric that indicates the percentage of changes that result in failure when deployed to production or other critical environments.

CFR is an important metric used to measure the effectiveness of an organization's change management process and the stability of their software delivery pipeline. It reflects how frequently changes are causing issues or disruptions in production systems, impacting customer experience and business operations.

A low CFR indicates a higher level of reliability and stability in the deployment process, suggesting that changes are well-tested, validated, and have minimal negative impact on production environments. On the other hand, a high CFR suggests that there are significant issues with change management practices, such as insufficient testing, poor communication, or lack of automation.

By tracking CFR over time, organizations can identify trends and patterns in change-related failures. This information can be used to drive improvements in software delivery practices, including adopting more rigorous testing strategies (e.g., automated testing), enhancing collaboration between teams responsible for development and operations, implementing better feedback loops for learning from failures, and investing in tools and technologies that support reliable deployments.

Overall, measuring CFR helps organizations assess the maturity of their DevOps practices by providing insights into their ability to deliver changes without causing disruptions or incidents in production environments.
