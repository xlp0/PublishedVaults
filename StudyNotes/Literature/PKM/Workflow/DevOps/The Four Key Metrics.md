#time #DORA 

The four key metrics to be measured by DevOps are:

1. [[Lead Time]]: This metric measures the time it takes for a code change to go from development to production. It helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the development and delivery process.

2. [[Deployment Frequency]]: This metric measures how often code changes are deployed to production. It indicates the frequency of releases and helps assess the organization's ability to deliver new features and bug fixes quickly.

3. [[MTTR|Mean Time to Recover]] ([[MTTR]]): MTTR measures how long it takes to recover from a service disruption or incident. It reflects the efficiency of incident response and resolution processes, highlighting areas that need improvement.

4. [[Change Failure Rate]]: This metric measures the percentage of changes that result in service disruptions or incidents. It helps assess the quality of code changes and highlights areas where testing and quality assurance processes can be improved.

Moreover, one should also consider [[Beyond Metrics]].
