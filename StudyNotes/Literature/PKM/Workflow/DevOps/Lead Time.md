#time

In the context of [[DORA]] (DevOps Research and Assessment), lead time refers to the time it takes for a change to be developed, tested, and deployed into production. It is one of the key metrics used to measure software delivery performance.

Lead time can be broken down into different components:

1. Development Time: This is the time taken for developers to code and build new features or changes.

2. Testing Time: It includes the time required to thoroughly test the changes made, ensuring they meet quality standards and don't introduce any regressions.

3. Deployment Time: The time taken to deploy the changes into production environments, including any necessary steps such as configuration management or release coordination.

Lead time is crucial because it directly impacts the speed at which organizations can deliver value to their customers. By reducing lead time, organizations can accelerate their ability to respond to market demands, deliver new features faster, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.

DORA's research emphasizes that high-performing organizations have shorter lead times compared to low performers. Such organizations typically have efficient development processes, effective automation in testing and deployment, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Measuring lead time helps teams identify bottlenecks in their software delivery process and enables them to focus on optimizing those areas. By continuously monitoring lead times, teams can track their progress towards improving software delivery performance over time.
