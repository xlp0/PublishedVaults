#MTTR #DevOps 

[[MTTR|Mean Time to Recover]] ([[MTTR]]) in [[DevOps]] terms refers to the average time taken to restore a service or system to normal functioning after a failure or incident occurs. It is a critical metric that measures the efficiency of incident response and recovery processes within an organization. A lower MTTR indicates faster incident resolution and better overall system reliability. To minimize MTTR, DevOps teams focus on implementing effective incident management practices, automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
