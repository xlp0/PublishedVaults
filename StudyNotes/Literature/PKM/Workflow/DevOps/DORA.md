These include continuous delivery, effective monitoring and observability practices, cross-functional collaboration, clear communication channels, automation, and an emphasis on learning and experimentation.

These services involve evaluating an organization's current practices, identifying areas for improvement, and providing recommendations for implementing DevOps principles effectively.

Overall, DORA plays a crucial role in advancing the understanding of DevOps practices by conducting research, providing insights through its reports, and offering assessment services to help organizations optimize their software delivery processes.
