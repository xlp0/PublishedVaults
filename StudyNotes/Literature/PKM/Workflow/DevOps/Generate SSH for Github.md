How to generate a new SSH key for Github

To generate a new SSH key for GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your computer.
2. Check if you already have an SSH key by entering the following command: 
```
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
 
 If you see files with names like `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa.pub`, you may already have an SSH key.
 
 If you don't have an SSH key, generate a new one by entering the following command: 
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your GitHub email address.

It will prompt you to enter a file location to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default location (`/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa`) or specify a different path if needed.

You will then be prompted to enter a passphrase (password) for your SSH key. You can either enter a passphrase or leave it blank for no passphrase (although it's generally recommended to use a passphrase).

Once the key is generated, you will see output similar to: 
   ```
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   SHA256:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX your_email@example.com
   The key's randomart image is:
   +---[RSA 4096]----+
   |  . . o..        |
   | . o *o..       |
   |E + =+o .       |
   | * O.*  .        |
   |    X ..S       |
   |     o.=        |
   |    ..+.o       |
   |     .=B..      |
   |    .==*.       |
   +----[SHA256]-----+
   ```

Now, add your SSH key to the ssh-agent by running the command: 
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
This starts the ssh-agent in the background.

Add your private key to the ssh-agent by running the command: 
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Next, copy your public key to your clipboard by running the command: 
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

If you don't have `pbcopy`, you can open and manually copy

## Can iPad Generate an SSH Key for Github verification

Yes, it is possible to generate an SSH key on an iPad for Github verification. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Install a SSH client app from the App Store on your iPad. Some popular options include "Termius," "Prompt," or "Blink Shell."

2. Open the SSH client app and create a new connection profile.

3. In the connection profile settings, provide your Github username and the hostname for the SSH connection (e.g., `github.com`).

4. Tap on "Generate Key" or a similar option within the app to create a new SSH key pair.

5. In the key generation process, you may have options to specify the key type and encryption algorithm. It is recommended to use RSA with at least 2048 bits.

6. Once you've generated the SSH key pair, save both the private and public keys to your iPad's local storage or a cloud storage service like iCloud Drive.

7. Copy the contents of the public key (usually found in a file with a `.pub` extension) to your clipboard.

8. Open Github in a web browser on your iPad and sign in to your account.

9. Go to your account settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner and selecting "Settings."

10. In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."

11. Click on "New SSH Key" or a similar button.

12. Give your SSH key a title (e.g., "iPad SSH Key") and paste the contents of your public key into the "Key" field.

13. Click on "Add SSH Key" or similar to add the SSH key to your Github account.

Your iPad is now configured with an SSH key that can be used for Github verification when accessing repositories via SSH protocols.
