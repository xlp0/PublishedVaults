Elastos is not just a cryptocurrency project, but a complete operating system for decentralized applications (dApps) utilizing blockchain technology. It aims to create a secure and trustworthy internet infrastructure by combining blockchain with existing technologies.

Elastos has its own native cryptocurrency called ELA, which serves as the utility token within the Elastos ecosystem. ELA can be used for various purposes such as paying for dApp services, accessing digital content, and participating in community governance.

The key features and components of Elastos include:

1. Decentralized Identity (DID): Elastos provides users with secure and decentralized digital identities, ensuring privacy and control over personal data.

2. Runtime Environment: Elastos separates applications from the operating system using its runtime environment, creating a sandboxed environment that enhances security and prevents malware attacks.

3. Sidechain Technology: Elastos uses sidechains to enable scalability and improve transaction speeds. This allows developers to build their own dApps while still benefiting from the security of the main blockchain.

4. Carrier Network: The Elastos Carrier Network provides peer-to-peer communication between devices without relying on traditional centralized servers. This enhances privacy and reduces the risk of censorship.

5. Smart Contracts: Elastos supports smart contracts that are compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to build decentralized applications using popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++.

6. Digital Asset Management: Elastos provides a secure platform for managing digital assets with features like traceability, ownership verification, and secure storage.

The ultimate goal of Elastos is to create a new internet infrastructure where users have full control over their data and can access trusted dApps without any intermediaries or centralized authorities. By combining blockchain technology with existing internet technologies, Elastos aims to build a more secure, private, and decentralized internet ecosystem.
