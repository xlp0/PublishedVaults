Luca Pacioli was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, and collaborator of Leonardo da Vinci. He is often referred to as the "Father of Accounting" due to his significant contributions to the field of mathematics and accounting.

Regarding his relationship with [[William Hamilton]] and [[Arthur Cayley]], it's important to note that Luca Pacioli lived during the 15th and 16th centuries, while Hamilton and Cayley were mathematicians who lived in the 19th century. Therefore, there was no direct in-person contact between them as they belonged to different time periods.

However, despite the temporal gap, Pacioli's work greatly influenced subsequent mathematicians like Hamilton and Cayley. His book "Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita" (Summary of Arithmetic, Geometry, Proportions, and Proportionality), published in 1494, contained a section on algebra which laid the foundation for future developments in mathematics.

Hamilton and Cayley were renowned mathematicians who made significant contributions to various branches of mathematics such as algebra and geometry. They both had explicitly stated that Luca Pacioli's work is interesting. Authur Cayley also published a small book particularly talked about the [[Double Entry Bookkeeping]].
