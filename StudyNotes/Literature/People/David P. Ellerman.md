[David P. Ellerman](https://www.ellerman.org/about-david-p-ellerman/) is an American economist, philosopher, and author known for his work on law and accounting. He has made significant contributions to the field of economics, particularly in the areas of labor theory and development economics.

Ellerman's interest in law and accounting stems from his belief that these fields have a profound impact on economic systems and social justice. He argues that the current legal and accounting frameworks perpetuate inequalities and undermine individual autonomy.

In his book "Property and Contract in Economics: The Case for Economic Democracy," Ellerman challenges the traditional understanding of property rights by advocating for economic democracy. He argues that property rights should not be seen as absolute, but rather as a social institution that can be shaped to promote fair distribution of wealth.

Furthermore, Ellerman has written extensively on the topic of labor theory, emphasizing the importance of employee empowerment within organizations. His book "The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm" proposes a model where workers have ownership stakes in their workplaces, promoting a more equitable distribution of profits.

Ellerman's works also touch upon topics such as participatory economics, market socialism, and democratic governance. He advocates for inclusive decision-making processes within organizations and society as a whole.

In the paper: [[@ellermanMathematicsDoubleEntry1985|The Mathematics of Double Entry Bookkeeping]], he also mentioned the [[Pacioli Group]].

Overall, David Ellerman's writings on law and accounting provide critical perspectives on how these fields shape economic systems. His work aims to challenge existing power structures and foster more equitable societies through economic democracy and worker empowerment.
