#Symmetry 

Emmy Noether was a German mathematician who is best known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. She was born on March 23, 1882, in Erlangen, Germany, and died on April 14, 1935.

Noether faced many challenges as a woman pursuing a career in mathematics during a time when the field was predominantly male-dominated. However, despite these obstacles, she managed to make significant advancements in the field.

Her most notable work lies in the field of abstract algebra, where she developed the concept of Noetherian rings and modules. This work laid the foundation for modern algebraic geometry and representation theory. Noether's theorem is also named after her, which connects symmetries in physics with conservation laws.

Noether was highly respected by her peers and had a profound impact on the mathematical community. She taught at various institutions throughout her career, including the University of GÃ¶ttingen. Despite not being officially appointed as a professor due to institutional gender bias at the time, she attracted many students who were drawn to her exceptional teaching skills and brilliant mind.

In addition to her mathematical contributions, Noether also made significant contributions to theoretical physics. She worked closely with renowned physicists like [[Albert Einstein]] and [[David Hilbert]]. Her insights into symmetry principles led to advancements in understanding fundamental physical laws such as conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

Tragically, Emmy Noether's life was cut short at the age of 53 due to complications from surgery. However, her legacy lives on through her groundbreaking work that continues to shape mathematics and theoretical physics to this day. She is remembered as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century and an inspiration for women pursuing careers in STEM fields.

## Emmy Noether and the principle of symmetry?

Emmy Noether practically founded the principle of [[symmetry]] through her groundbreaking work in the field of mathematics and theoretical physics. She developed a theorem known as [[Noether's theorem]], which connects symmetries in physical systems to conservation laws.

Noether's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry in a physical system, there exists a corresponding conservation law. In other words, if a physical system remains unchanged under certain transformations (symmetries), then there will be quantities that are conserved in that system.

For example, if the laws of physics remain unchanged under translations in space or time, then momentum and energy are conserved respectively. If the laws of physics remain unchanged under rotations, then angular momentum is conserved.

Emmy Noether's theorem has had profound implications in various areas of physics, such as classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and field theory. It provides a deep understanding of the fundamental connection between symmetries and conservation laws in nature.
