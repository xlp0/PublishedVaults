Vladimir Voevodsky was a prominent Russian mathematician known for his contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry and mathematical logic. He was born on June 4, 1966, in Moscow, Russia, and passed away on September 30, 2017.

Voevodsky's work focused on developing new concepts and techniques to study algebraic varieties and their cohomology. His most significant achievement was the development of a new branch of mathematics called homotopy type theory. This theory aims to establish a connection between abstract homotopy theory and constructive type theory.

In 2002, Voevodsky received the Fields Medal, which is one of the highest honors in mathematics. He was awarded this prestigious prize for his groundbreaking work on proving the Milnor conjecture using motivic cohomology. This achievement further solidified his reputation as one of the leading mathematicians of his time.

Apart from his research contributions, Voevodsky also played an active role in promoting open-source software development in mathematics. He initiated the development of several important mathematical software projects that facilitated collaboration and made mathematical research more accessible to others.

Vladimir Voevodsky's untimely death in 2017 was a great loss to the mathematical community. However, his legacy lives on through his numerous publications and influential contributions to various areas of mathematics. His work continues to inspire and shape modern research in algebraic geometry and related fields.

### What is the most famous project that Voevodsky worked on right before his unexpected death?

The most famous project that Voevodsky worked on right before his unexpected death was the [[Univalent Foundations]] program. This program aimed to develop a new foundation for mathematics based on homotopy type theory, which provided a novel way to understand and formalize mathematical concepts. Voevodsky's work in this area had a profound impact on the field of mathematics and has continued to influence ongoing research in related areas.
