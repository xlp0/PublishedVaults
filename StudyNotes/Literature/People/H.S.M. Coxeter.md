H.S.M. Coxeter, whose full name is Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, was a renowned mathematician and geometrician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of geometry and group theory. He was born on February 9, 1907, in London, England, and passed away on March 31, 2003.

Coxeter's work primarily focused on the study of regular polytopes, polyhedra, and their higher-dimensional analogs. He made groundbreaking discoveries in this field and developed numerous theories and concepts that are now widely used in mathematics. One of his most notable achievements was his exploration of higher-dimensional geometries beyond three dimensions.

He introduced the concept of [[Coxeter Group|Coxeter groups]], which are groups generated by reflections. These groups play a crucial role in various branches of mathematics and have applications in crystallography, physics, and computer science. Coxeter also formulated the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams to classify these reflection groups.

Coxeter's work extended beyond just theoretical results; he also provided elegant visualizations and diagrams to explain complex geometric concepts. His drawings were highly influential and helped researchers better understand the intricate structures of polytopes.

In addition to his contributions to geometry, Coxeter also worked on other mathematical fields such as number theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. His research encompassed a wide range of topics within mathematics.

Coxeter authored numerous papers throughout his career and published several books that became fundamental references for mathematicians worldwide. Some of his well-known works include "Regular Polytopes," "Introduction to Geometry," "Non-Euclidean Geometry," "Projective Geometry," among others.

Moreover, Coxeter had a profound impact on the mathematical community through his teaching career. He held positions at various prestigious institutions such as the University of Toronto and Princeton University. His teaching style was known for its clarity and elegance.

Throughout his lifetime, Coxeter received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to mathematics. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Society of Canada. He was also awarded the Jeffery-Williams Prize, the CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize, and the Order of Canada, among others.

H.S.M. Coxeter's work continues to influence mathematicians and geometricians to this day. His deep insights into geometry and his ability to communicate complex ideas in a visually appealing manner have made him one of the most celebrated mathematicians in his field.
