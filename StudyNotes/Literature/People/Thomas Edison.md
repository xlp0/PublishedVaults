Thomas Edison was an American inventor and businessman who is considered one of the greatest inventors in history. He was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, and died on October 18, 1931, in West Orange, New Jersey.

Edison's most famous invention was the [[light bulbs|practical electric light bulb]], which revolutionized the way people live and work. However, he held over 1,000 patents for various inventions throughout his lifetime.

In addition to his work on electric lighting, Edison also invented the phonograph (a device for recording and playing back sound) and made significant improvements to the motion picture camera. He established the world's first industrial research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where he developed numerous innovations.

Edison had a relentless work ethic and was known for his perseverance in conducting experiments and finding solutions to problems. He once famously said that "genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." His dedication to hard work earned him the nickname "The Wizard of Menlo Park."

Aside from his technical contributions, Edison played a crucial role in establishing America's modern electricity system. He founded several companies that eventually merged to form General Electric (GE), one of the world's largest conglomerates.

Despite his remarkable success as an inventor and businessman, Edison also faced criticism for allegedly stealing ideas from other inventors or taking credit for their work. Notably, there were disputes with [[Nikola Tesla]] regarding the development of alternating current (AC) versus direct current (DC) systems.

Thomas Edison's impact on society cannot be overstated. His inventions transformed industries such as communication, entertainment, and power generation. His innovative spirit continues to inspire countless inventors and entrepreneurs around the world.
