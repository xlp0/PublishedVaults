Richard Stallman, born on March 16, 1953, is an American software developer and a prominent figure in the free software movement. He is best known for founding the Free Software Foundation ([[FSF]]) in 1985 and for initiating the development of the GNU operating system.

Stallman's work and philosophy have had a significant impact on the software industry and beyond. He strongly advocates for free software, which refers to computer programs that respect users' freedom by allowing them to run, study, modify, and distribute the software as they wish. Stallman believes that proprietary software restricts users' freedom and control over their own computing devices.

One of Stallman's most significant contributions is the development of the GNU Project. In 1983, he announced plans to create a complete Unix-like operating system composed entirely of free software. Although the kernel was missing initially, in 1992 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, which combined with GNU tools to create what is now known as GNU/Linux or simply Linux.

Stallman has also played a crucial role in creating various free software licenses. The most famous one is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which ensures that any derivative works based on free software are also licensed under GPL, thereby preserving users' freedoms.

Besides his technical accomplishments, Stallman has been an outspoken activist for digital rights and privacy. He has campaigned against various issues like digital restrictions management (DRM), software patents, and mass surveillance.

However, Richard Stallman's views and behavior have been controversial at times. His staunch positions on certain topics have led to conflicts within the community. In recent years, some of his statements were criticized as being insensitive or inappropriate.

Nevertheless, Richard Stallman's contributions to advancing free software cannot be denied or understated. His advocacy has inspired countless developers worldwide to embrace open-source principles and promote user freedom in technology.
