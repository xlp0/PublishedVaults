Professor Dov Dori is a renowned computer scientist and engineer who is currently affiliated with Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. He is the creator of [[OPM|Object Process Methodology]] (OPM), a modeling language and methodology used for systems engineering.

Prof. Dori obtained his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University, followed by a Master's degree in Operations Research from the same institution. He then pursued his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Throughout his career, Prof. Dori has made significant contributions to the fields of systems engineering, software engineering, and modeling and simulation methodologies. His research focuses on developing innovative approaches to tackle complex problems in these domains.

One of Prof. Dori's major achievements is the development of Object Process Methodology (OPM). OPM provides a graphical notation for capturing and representing the structure, behavior, and dynamics of systems. It allows engineers to model various aspects of a system, including objects, processes, states, events, and relationships between them.

OPM has gained widespread recognition as a powerful tool for system design and analysis. It enables engineers to create comprehensive models that assist in understanding system requirements, identifying potential issues or bottlenecks, and facilitating effective communication among stakeholders.

In addition to his work on OPM, Prof. Dori has published numerous research papers and authored several books on topics related to systems engineering and modeling languages. He has also served as an advisor to government agencies and industries on matters related to technology development.

Prof. Dov Dori's contributions have been recognized globally through numerous awards and honors bestowed upon him over the years. He continues to be an influential figure in the field of systems engineering and remains dedicated to advancing the use of modeling methodologies for complex systems.
