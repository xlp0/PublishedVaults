Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) was a British mathematician and logician. He is best known for his work in the field of mathematical logic and for his contributions to algebra and set theory. De Morgan introduced the concept of mathematical induction and made important advancements in the understanding of propositional logic.

He developed [[De Morgan's Laws]], which are fundamental principles in Boolean algebra that describe the relationships between logical operations such as conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR). These laws are still widely used today in computer science and digital circuit design.

De Morgan also made significant contributions to the theory of probability, calculus, and formal logic. He served as the first professor of mathematics at University College London and was a founding member of the London Mathematical Society.

Overall, Augustus De Morgan played a crucial role in advancing the field of mathematics and logic, leaving a lasting impact on various areas within the discipline.
