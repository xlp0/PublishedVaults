Leonard Adleman is an American computer scientist and mathematician who is best known for his role in the development of the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm. Born on December 31, 1945, in San Francisco, California, Adleman has made significant contributions to various fields of computer science.

In the late 1970s, Adleman, along with his colleagues [[Ron Rivest]] and [[Adi Shamir]], developed the RSA algorithm, which is named after their last names. RSA is a public-key cryptosystem widely used for secure communication and data encryption over the internet. It was one of the first practical methods for secure communication using cryptographic keys.

The RSA algorithm works on the principle of utilizing two different mathematical keys - a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. The security of RSA lies in the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers into their original primes.

Adleman's work on RSA was groundbreaking as it provided a secure method for exchanging encrypted messages over insecure networks like the internet. This encryption method has become widely adopted and forms the basis for many secure online transactions we use today, including online banking, e-commerce websites, and secure email communication.

Apart from his work on RSA, Leonard Adleman has made significant contributions to various other areas of computer science. He has worked on DNA computing and is considered one of the pioneers in this field. Adleman demonstrated that DNA molecules could be manipulated to perform computations by solving a simple instance of what is known as the "traveling salesman problem."

Leonard Adleman's contributions to computer science have been recognized with numerous awards and honors throughout his career. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2006 and received several prestigious awards such as the Turing Award in 2002 and the Franklin Medal in Computer Science in 2010.

In summary, Leonard Adleman is a renowned computer scientist known for his co-invention of the RSA encryption algorithm. His work has revolutionized secure communication and played a crucial role in ensuring the privacy and security of online transactions.
