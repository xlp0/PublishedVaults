Kenneth Arrow was an American economist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the fields of economics and social choice theory. He was born on August 23, 1921, in New York City and passed away on February 21, 2017, in Palo Alto, California.

Arrow completed his undergraduate studies at the City College of New York before earning his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University at the age of 23. He then joined the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago.

Arrow's most famous work is his book "Social Choice and Individual Values," published in 1951. In this book, he introduced what is now known as [[Arrow's Impossibility Theorem]]. The theorem states that no voting system can consistently reflect individual preferences while satisfying certain desirable criteria such as transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

Throughout his career, Arrow made significant contributions to various areas of economics, including general equilibrium theory, welfare economics, health economics, and information economics. He received numerous accolades for his work and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1972 for his pioneering contributions to welfare theory and social choice theory.

Apart from his academic pursuits, Arrow also served as an advisor to several government agencies and organizations. He played a key role in shaping economic policy during the Kennedy administration and served on various committees related to healthcare reform.

Kenneth Arrow's work continues to influence economists and policymakers around the world. His research on social choice theory remains highly relevant today as societies grapple with issues of democratic decision-making and public welfare.
