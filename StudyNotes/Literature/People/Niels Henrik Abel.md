[[Niels Henrik Abel]] was a Norwegian mathematician born on August 5, 1802, in the small town of Finn√∏y, Norway. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century and made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics, particularly in algebra and analysis.

Abel displayed exceptional mathematical talent from an early age. Unfortunately, his father died when he was just two years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his five siblings. Despite financial difficulties, Abel's mother recognized his potential and encouraged his academic pursuits.

In 1821, Abel enrolled at the University of Oslo (then known as the Royal Frederick University) to study theology. However, he quickly shifted his focus to mathematics after attending lectures by prominent mathematician Bernt Holmboe. Abel's innate mathematical abilities became evident during this time as he independently solved several unsolved problems in algebra.

One of Abel's most significant contributions is his proof of the impossibility of solving [[Quintic Equation|quintic equations]] using radicals (known as Abel-Ruffini theorem). This theorem demonstrated that there is no general algebraic solution for equations of degree five or higher. His work established a foundation for the development of abstract algebra.

## Commutativity and Abelness

[[Commutativity]] refers to the property of a mathematical operation that states the order in which the operands are taken does not affect the result. In other words, if an operation is commutative, it means that swapping the order of the operands does not change the outcome.

For example, addition is a commutative operation because for any two numbers a and b, a + b = b + a. This is evident in basic arithmetic, where 2 + 3 yields the same result as 3 + 2.

In contrast, subtraction is not commutative because for any two numbers a and b, a - b does not equal b - a. For example, 5 - 3 is not equal to 3 - 5.

Now let's discuss an Abel group. An Abel group, also known as an Abelian group, is a special type of mathematical structure consisting of a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element, where every element has an inverse and the operation is commutative.

Formally, an Abel group G is defined by four properties:
1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in G, their combination (a * b) is also in G.
2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).
3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for any element g in G, e * g = g * e = g.
4. Inverse: For every element g in G, there exists another element h in G such that g * h = h * g = e (the identity).

An example of an Abel group is the set of integers under addition. Each integer has its own inverse (e.g., for number 2 there exists -2), and addition is commutative.

In summary, commutativity refers to the property of an operation where the order of operands does not affect the outcome, while an Abel group is a mathematical structure that possesses an associative binary operation, identity element, inverses for every element, and commutativity.

## Elliptic Functions and their Integrals
Another notable achievement by Abel was his establishment of elliptic functions and their integrals. He introduced these functions as a generalization of trigonometric functions and discovered many fundamental properties related to them. His research in this area laid the groundwork for future developments in complex analysis.

Despite his groundbreaking work, Abel faced significant challenges throughout his life. He struggled with poverty and lack of recognition during his lifetime, which impacted both his personal and professional life. Tragically, at the age of only 26, he contracted tuberculosis and succumbed to the disease on April 6, 1829.

# Conclusion
Although Abel's life was cut short at just 26 years old, his contributions to mathematics were profound. His work influenced subsequent generations of mathematicians, and his ideas continue to be significant in various branches of mathematics. Today, he is widely celebrated as one of the greatest mathematicians in history, and his name is honored through several mathematical concepts, including the Abel Prize, which is considered one of the highest honors in mathematics.
