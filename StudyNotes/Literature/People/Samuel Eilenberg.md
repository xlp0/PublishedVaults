[Samuel Eilenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Eilenberg) (1913-1998) was a prominent Polish-American mathematician known for his significant contributions to algebraic topology and [[Category theory|category theory]]. He was born on September 30, 1913, in Warsaw, Poland. Eilenberg studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw before fleeing to the United States in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II.

In the early 1940s, Eilenberg began working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he collaborated with fellow mathematician [[Saunders Mac Lane]]. Together, they developed the concept of category theory, which revolutionized algebraic topology and laid the foundation for various branches of modern mathematics.

Eilenberg and Mac Lane's work on category theory led to the publication of their influential book "General Theory of Natural Equivalences" in 1945. This book introduced many fundamental concepts and ideas in category theory, such as functors and natural transformations.

Eilenberg continued to make significant contributions to mathematics throughout his career. He worked extensively on homological algebra and cohomology theories. His work on homological algebra provided a powerful tool for studying algebraic structures through their associated chain complexes.

One of Eilenberg's most notable achievements was his collaboration with Norman Steenrod in developing axioms for homology theory known as [[Eilenbergâ€“Steenrod axioms]]. These axioms provided a rigorous foundation for studying topological spaces using algebraic methods.

Eilenberg also made contributions to automata theory and theoretical computer science by developing an algebraic approach to formal languages and automata. This work had applications in computer science, particularly in compiler design and programming language theory.

Throughout his career, Eilenberg received numerous honors and awards for his exceptional mathematical contributions. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1966 and received several honorary degrees from prestigious institutions worldwide.

Samuel Eilenberg's work continues to influence and inspire mathematicians today. His contributions to algebraic topology, category theory, and homological algebra have had a profound impact on various fields of mathematics, making him one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.
