Object Process Methodology (OPM) is a systems engineering approach developed by [[Dov Dori]], an Israeli computer scientist. OPM provides a comprehensive modeling language and methodology for analyzing and designing complex systems. It aims to capture the structure, behavior, and functionality of systems in a holistic manner.

OPM is based on the concept of objects, processes, and states. Objects represent entities in the system, processes represent activities or behaviors that objects undergo, and states represent the conditions or modes in which objects exist. OPM allows modeling both static aspects (structure) and dynamic aspects (behavior) of systems.

OPM also supports the integration of multiple views in system modeling, such as structural, functional, behavioral, and information views. This allows stakeholders to analyze different aspects of the system from various perspectives.

The benefits of using OPM include improved communication among stakeholders due to its visual nature, enhanced understanding of complex systems through holistic modeling techniques, and better decision-making based on comprehensive analysis.

In summary, Object Process Methodology by Dov Dori provides a structured approach for modeling complex systems using objects, processes, and states. Object Process Networks are an integral part of OPM that facilitate the representation of system behavior through graphical depictions of object interactions.
