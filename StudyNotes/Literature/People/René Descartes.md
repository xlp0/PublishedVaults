René Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist who is often regarded as the father of modern philosophy. He lived from 1596 to 1650 and is best known for his philosophical works, particularly his famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am). Descartes played a crucial role in the development of rationalism, which emphasizes reason as the primary source of knowledge.

Antoine Arnauld was a French theologian and philosopher who was a contemporary of Descartes. He was known for his defense of Jansenism, a theological movement within Catholicism that emphasized human depravity and divine grace. Arnauld engaged in philosophical debates with Descartes on various topics such as theology, metaphysics, and epistemology.

Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who also lived during the same period as Descartes. Although Pascal is primarily known for his contributions to mathematics and physics (such as Pascal's law and Pascal's triangle), he also engaged in philosophical discussions with Descartes. Pascal criticized some aspects of Descartes' philosophy and had his own unique ideas on religion and ethics.

In summary, both [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] had philosophical interactions with René Descartes during their lifetimes. They engaged in debates on various topics related to philosophy, theology, mathematics, and science. These interactions played a significant role in shaping the intellectual landscape of their time.
