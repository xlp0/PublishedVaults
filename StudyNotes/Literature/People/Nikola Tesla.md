Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and physicist. He was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), and died on January 7, 1943, in New York City.

Tesla is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply system. He developed numerous inventions and made significant discoveries in various fields such as electricity, magnetism, radio waves, wireless communication, robotics, and more.

One of Tesla's most significant achievements was the development and promotion of AC power transmission. He demonstrated that alternating current was a more efficient and practical method for distributing electricity over long distances compared to Thomas Edison's direct current (DC) systems. Tesla's work laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of AC power systems that we use today.

Tesla held many patents throughout his lifetime. Some notable inventions include the Tesla coil (used in wireless transmission experiments), the induction motor (a highly efficient electric motor), wireless power transfer technology, fluorescent lighting systems, remote control devices, and early versions of X-ray imaging.

Despite his brilliant mind and groundbreaking work, Tesla faced financial difficulties throughout his life. Many of his projects were funded by wealthy investors who often took credit for his inventions. This led to some disputes and legal battles over patent rights.

In later years, Tesla's ideas became increasingly eccentric. He became fixated on wireless energy transmission projects that were never fully realized but have inspired ongoing research in modern times. Tesla also claimed to have developed a "death ray" weapon during World War II but never revealed its details or demonstrated its existence.

Nikola Tesla's contributions to science and technology cannot be overstated. His work laid the foundation for many modern technologies we rely on today. Despite facing financial struggles and personal setbacks during his lifetime, he left an indelible mark on the world and his legacy continues to be celebrated by scientists, engineers, and inventors.
