Évariste Galois was a French mathematician who lived from 1811 to 1832. He is best known for his groundbreaking work in the field of algebra, particularly in the theory of equations and group theory. Galois made significant contributions to the understanding of [[symmetry]], which played a crucial role in his mathematical achievements.

Galois was fascinated by the concept of symmetry and its applications in mathematics. He was particularly interested in understanding the nature of solutions to polynomial equations and their relationship with symmetries. His research led him to develop what is now known as Galois theory, which revolutionized algebraic thinking.

One of Galois' most important discoveries was the concept of a Galois group, which is a mathematical structure that describes the symmetries inherent in solving polynomial equations. He showed that there is a deep connection between the existence of symmetries and whether or not an equation can be solved using radicals (expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and root extraction).

Galois' work on symmetry and group theory laid the foundation for modern abstract algebra. His theories provided a rigorous framework for studying symmetries in mathematics and led to many subsequent developments and applications across various branches of science.

Unfortunately, Galois' life was cut short as he died at the age of 20 due to a duel. However, his ideas lived on and greatly influenced subsequent mathematicians like Élie Joseph Cartan, Felix Klein, and Sophus Lie. Today, Galois theory remains a fundamental tool in many areas of mathematics such as number theory, geometry, cryptography, physics, and computer science.
