Emilio Frazzoli is an Italian-American scientist and academician known for his contributions to the fields of robotics, autonomous driving, and motion planning. He has a strong connection with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([[MIT]]) and has made significant contributions to various research projects and initiatives there.

At MIT, Frazzoli has been affiliated with the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics since 2005. He served as a professor in the department and held the position of director at both the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and the Transportation@MIT initiative. His work at MIT primarily focused on developing algorithms and methodologies for motion planning in autonomous systems.

One notable project that Frazzoli was involved in at MIT is the development of the [[MPL|Motion Planning Language]] ([[MPL]]), which is a high-level programming language specifically designed for motion planning tasks. MPL provides a way to describe complex motion planning problems in a concise manner, making it easier to design algorithms and implement them in real-world systems. 

One related project associated with Emilio Frazzoli is [[Duckie Town]]. Duckie Town is a miniature model city developed by Frazzoli's team at MIT to simulate real-world driving scenarios for testing and validating autonomous driving algorithms. The city consists of small-scale roads, intersections, traffic lights, and various obstacles that mimic real-world challenges. Duckie Town provides a controlled environment where researchers can test their algorithms before applying them in actual autonomous vehicles. It allows for rapid prototyping, debugging, and benchmarking of different methods for perception, planning, and control.

Emilio Frazzoli's involvement with Duckie Town showcases his commitment to advancing autonomous driving through innovative research methodologies. His work contributes to the broader goal of creating safer and more efficient transportation systems using autonomous vehicle technologies.

Frazzoli's expertise also extends to autonomous driving technology. He has been actively researching and working on developing algorithms for autonomous vehicles that can effectively navigate through complex traffic scenarios while ensuring safety. His work in this field has contributed to advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, making them more reliable and capable of operating in real-world environments.

In addition to his work at MIT, Frazzoli has recently been involved with ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). In 2018, he joined ETH Zurich as a professor of Dynamic Systems and Control. At ETH, he continues his research on autonomous systems, focusing on topics such as aerial robotics, intelligent transportation systems, and networked control systems.

Frazzoli's involvement with ETH further strengthens his position as a leading expert in robotics and autonomous systems. His research contributions have not only advanced the field academically but also have practical implications for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
