Haskell Curry, also known as H. B. Curry, was an American mathematician and logician. He was born on September 12, 1900, in Millis, Massachusetts, and passed away on September 1, 1982.

Curry made significant contributions to the fields of mathematical [[Logic|logic]] and formal systems. He is best known for his work in combinatory logic and the development of Curry's paradox. His ideas greatly influenced the development of computer science, particularly in the area of functional programming.

In combinatory logic, Curry introduced a notation system called combinators that eliminated the need for variables and provided a foundation for understanding functions in a purely symbolic way. This work laid the groundwork for later developments such as lambda calculus and functional programming languages like Haskell.

Curry also made important contributions to type theory and proof theory. He developed a system called "[[Curry-Howard correspondence]]," which establishes a connection between proofs in logic and types in programming languages. This correspondence has become a fundamental concept in modern computer science.

Despite his significant contributions to mathematics and logic, Curry's work was often underappreciated during his lifetime. It was not until later years that his ideas gained broader recognition and influence.

Haskell Curry's legacy continues to be celebrated today through various awards named after him, such as the Haskell Curry Award from the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). His work remains foundational to the study of formal systems, logic, type theory, and functional programming.
