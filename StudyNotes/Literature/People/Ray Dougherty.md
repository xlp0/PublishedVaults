[Ray C. Dougherty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_C._Dougherty) (born 1940) is an American linguist and was a member of the Arts and Science faculty at [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University") until 2014 (retired). He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from [Dartmouth College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College "Dartmouth College") in the early 1960s and his Ph.D. in linguistics from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") in 1968. At MIT, Dougherty was one of the first students of [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky"), working in the field of [transformational grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_grammar "Transformational grammar"). During the [Linguistics Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics_Wars "Linguistics Wars") of the 1970s, Dougherty was a critic of the [generative semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_semantics "Generative semantics") movement. Specializing in [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics "Computational linguistics"), Dougherty has published several books and articles on the subject.

In recent years, Dougherty has become interested in the study of [biolinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biolinguistics "Biolinguistics"), focusing on the role of the [cochlea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea "Cochlea") in the evolution of animal communication systems and naturalistic applications of [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory").

Dougherty has made numerous contributions to advancing the study of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics") at New York University.
