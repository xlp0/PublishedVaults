Sir Andrew John Wiles is a British mathematician renowned for proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. He was born on April 11, 1953, in Cambridge, England. Wiles studied mathematics at Oxford University and later completed his Ph.D. at Clare College, Cambridge.

Wiles' fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem began when he encountered it as a young boy. In 1994, after years of intense research and secretive work, he announced a proof for the theorem during a lecture at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences. His proof was based on advanced mathematical concepts such as elliptic curves and modular forms.

Wiles' groundbreaking achievement earned him numerous prestigious awards and honors, including the Abel Prize, the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences, and the Royal Society's Copley Medal. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society and has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to mathematics.

Apart from his work on Fermat's Last Theorem, Wiles has made significant contributions to other areas of number theory and algebraic geometry. He continues to inspire and influence future generations of mathematicians through his teaching and research at Princeton University, where he has been a professor since 1982.
