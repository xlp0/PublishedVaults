Albert Einstein was a renowned physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists in history. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire (now Germany), and he passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

Einstein is best known for his [[Theory of Relativity|theory of relativity]], which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. In 1905, he published his groundbreaking paper on the special theory of relativity, introducing the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c). This equation showed that mass and energy are interchangeable, leading to the concept of mass-energy equivalence.

In 1915, Einstein formulated the general theory of relativity, providing a new understanding of gravity. He proposed that gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. The theory made several predictions, including the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of black holes. Subsequent experimental observations confirmed these predictions, solidifying Einstein's reputation as a groundbreaking physicist.

In addition to his work on relativity, Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory and the understanding of the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His work helped establish the concept of photons and contributed to the development of quantum mechanics.

Einstein's scientific achievements were accompanied by his keen interest in philosophical and social issues. He was known for his pacifism, advocating for nuclear disarmament and international cooperation. Einstein was also involved in civil rights movements, speaking out against racism and oppression.
