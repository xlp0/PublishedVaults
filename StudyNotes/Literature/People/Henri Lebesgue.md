[[Henri Lebesgue|Henri Léon Lebesgue]] (June 28, 1875 – July 26, 1941) was a French mathematician known for his contributions to various areas of mathematics, particularly in the fields of real analysis, measure theory, and integration theory. He is best known for introducing the concept of the Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue integral, which revolutionized the study of integration and laid the groundwork for modern probability theory.

[[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] was born in Beauvais, France. He showed early mathematical talent and eventually pursued higher education at the Collège de France and the Sorbonne (University of Paris). His groundbreaking work on measure theory and integration began around 1902 and culminated with the publication of his famous paper "Intégrale, Longueur, Aire" (Integration, Length, Area) in 1904, where he introduced the Lebesgue measure and integral.

The [[Lebesgue Measure|Lebesgue measure]] and integral provided a more general and flexible framework for integrating a broader class of functions, including those that were not well-suited for the traditional Riemann integral. Lebesgue's approach allowed mathematicians to work with functions that were more irregular, discontinuous, or undefined in certain regions. This innovation had profound implications for various branches of mathematics, including analysis, probability theory, and functional analysis.

Lebesgue's work in measure theory laid the foundation for the development of the modern theory of [[Probability Theory|probability]], where the Lebesgue integral provided a way to generalize and formalize the notion of probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions.

Apart from his contributions to measure theory, Lebesgue also made significant contributions to other areas of mathematics, including number theory, complex analysis, and set theory. He held academic positions in France throughout his career and was elected to prestigious organizations like the French Academy of Sciences.

Henri Lebesgue's work has had a lasting impact on mathematics, and his concepts and techniques are still widely used in advanced mathematics and its applications today. He is remembered as a key figure in the development of modern analysis and integration theory, and his legacy continues to influence mathematicians and researchers around the world.
