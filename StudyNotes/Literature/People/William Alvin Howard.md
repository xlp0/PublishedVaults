William Alvin Howard is an American mathematician and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the field of logic and the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]. He was born on December 29, 1941, in Houston, Texas.

Howard is best known for his work on the Curry-Howard correspondence, which is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematical logic. The correspondence establishes a connection between formal systems of mathematical proof and functional programming languages. It states that there is a deep relationship between proofs in logic (specifically intuitionistic logic) and programs in functional programming languages.

In 1969, Howard published a groundbreaking paper titled "The Formulae-as-Types Notion of Construction," where he introduced what is now known as the "Howard-Curry Isomorphism." This work extended and clarified the Curry-Howard correspondence, providing a more formal understanding of the relationship between proofs and programs.

The Howard-Curry Isomorphism essentially shows that logical formulas can be seen as types in programming languages, while logical proofs can be seen as programs inhabiting those types. This insight has had a profound impact on both computer science and mathematical logic.

Throughout his career, Howard has made numerous other contributions to type theory, constructive mathematics, category theory, and automated reasoning. He has published several influential papers on these topics.

In addition to his work on the Curry-Howard correspondence, Howard has also been involved in developing programming languages and software systems. He was part of the team that designed the POP-2 programming language at the University of Edinburgh in the late 1960s.

William Alvin Howard's work continues to be widely studied and cited by researchers in computer science and mathematical logic. His contributions have significantly advanced our understanding of the connection between formal systems of proof and functional programming languages.
