John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist who made significant contributions to various fields. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the development of computer architecture and modern computing.

In terms of his involvement with computers, von Neumann played a crucial role in the design and development of the [[ENIAC|Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer]] ([[ENIAC]]) during World War II. ENIAC was one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers and marked a major advancement in computing technology. Von Neumann worked closely with other scientists to develop ENIAC's logical design, programming techniques, and mathematical foundations.

Von Neumann is best known for his concept of the von Neumann architecture, which forms the basis for most modern computers. The von Neumann architecture separates memory from processing units and allows instructions and data to be stored in the same memory space. This idea revolutionized computer design by introducing the idea of storing programs as [[Data|data]], enabling more efficient programming and easier modification of computer instructions.

While von Neumann made significant contributions to computer science, he also had a profound impact on quantum mechanics. His work in quantum theory focused on foundational aspects such as measurement theory and quantum logic. He contributed to developing mathematical frameworks to describe quantum mechanics accurately.

One notable contribution was his formulation of the theory of self-adjoint extensions, which provided a rigorous mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. This work allowed for a better understanding of quantum phenomena and helped reconcile inconsistencies in earlier formulations.

Von Neumann's book "[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mathematical_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics)" is considered a classic in the field. It presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for describing quantum phenomena, including concepts such as superposition, wave-particle duality, and entanglement.

In summary, John von Neumann's involvement with computers includes his contribution to designing ENIAC and developing the concept of von Neumann architecture that forms the basis for modern computers. He also made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, particularly in developing mathematical frameworks and foundational aspects of the field.
