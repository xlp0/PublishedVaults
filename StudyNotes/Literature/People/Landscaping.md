In [[Jeanne-Marie Gescher]]'s political and cultural study, landscaping refers to the process of modifying and shaping the natural environment for aesthetic or practical purposes. It encompasses various aspects such as gardening, horticulture, and design principles to create visually appealing outdoor spaces.

From a political perspective, landscaping can be seen as a reflection of power relations and social hierarchies. The design and maintenance of landscapes often mirror the values and preferences of individuals or communities in positions of authority. For example, grand palaces or public parks designed by rulers may showcase their wealth and influence.

Culturally, landscaping plays a significant role in shaping people's relationship with nature and their surroundings. Different cultures have distinct approaches to landscaping, influenced by their beliefs, traditions, and aesthetics. For instance, Japanese gardens emphasize harmony with nature and incorporate Zen principles of simplicity and balance.

Gescher's study may explore how landscaping practices are linked to broader political ideologies or cultural expressions within a specific society or historical context. The study might delve into topics such as the transformation of landscapes for political propaganda or the influence of cultural norms on garden design.

Overall, landscaping in Gescher's political and cultural study examines the multifaceted connections between human intervention in natural environments, power dynamics, cultural expressions, and societal values.

Jeanne-Marie Gescher's Landscaping is closely related to her [[Triple Capital]] and [[Beyond Metrics]] ideas in several ways:

1. Triple Capital: Gescher's Triple Capital framework focuses on three interconnected forms of capital - natural, social, and financial - that are essential for sustainable development. Landscaping plays a crucial role in enhancing and preserving natural capital by creating and maintaining green spaces, conserving biodiversity, and promoting ecological balance. It involves the careful design and management of landscapes to maximize their environmental benefits and contribute to the overall well-being of communities.

2. Beyond Metrics: Beyond Metrics is Gescher's approach to measuring success beyond traditional financial metrics by considering the broader impacts on people, planet, and prosperity. Landscaping aligns with this concept as it goes beyond aesthetics and incorporates various qualitative aspects that contribute to human well-being, such as improved mental health, enhanced community cohesion, increased property values, and reduced air pollution.

3. Integration of Capitals: Gescher emphasizes the importance of integrating different forms of capital rather than viewing them in isolation. Landscaping acts as a bridge between natural capital (ecosystems) and social capital (communities). By creating well-designed landscapes that provide recreational spaces, promote social interactions, and support cultural activities, landscaping facilitates the integration of natural and social capitals. Moreover, it can also have economic benefits by attracting tourism, improving property values, and supporting local businesses.

In summary, Jeanne-Marie Gescher's Landscaping relates to her Triple Capital concept by enhancing natural capital through sustainable landscape design practices. It also aligns with her Beyond Metrics idea by considering the broader impacts on people's quality of life beyond traditional financial measurements. Finally, landscaping helps integrate different forms of capital by connecting natural ecosystems with social communities through well-designed landscapes that provide various benefits for individuals and society as a whole.
