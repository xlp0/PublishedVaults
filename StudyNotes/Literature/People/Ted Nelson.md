Tell me about Ted Nelson

Ted Nelson is an American philosopher, sociologist, and computer pioneer. He is best known for coining the term "[[Hypertext|hypertext]]" and for his work on Project Xanadu, an early vision of a global hypertext system. Born on June 17, 1937, in Illinois, Nelson has contributed significantly to the field of information technology and computer science.

Nelson attended Swarthmore College and earned a degree in philosophy. He later pursued graduate studies at Harvard University but left before completing his Ph.D. to focus on his passion for computers. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked on developing a revolutionary system called [[Project Xanadu]].

Project Xanadu aimed to create a universal network where users could access and link different types of information seamlessly. Nelson envisioned a world where anyone could publish their work online and receive fair compensation for it. This idea of two-way linking was a precursor to the modern concept of hyperlinks that we use today on the World Wide Web.

Although Project Xanadu never fully materialized as originally envisioned, Nelson's ideas laid the foundation for many innovations in computing technology. His concept of hypertext influenced the development of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) used in creating web pages.

In addition to his work on hypertext systems, Ted Nelson has been an outspoken critic of mainstream computing practices. He has criticized companies like Apple and Microsoft for their closed systems that limit user freedom and creativity (See [[Data Sovereignty]]). Nelson advocates for open standards and greater user control over their own data.

Throughout his career, Ted Nelson has published numerous books and articles discussing his ideas about computers, society, media, and information management. He continues to be an active thinker in the field of information technology and remains an influential figure in computer science.

Overall, Ted Nelson's contributions to computer science have shaped the way we interact with digital information today. His visionary ideas continue to inspire researchers and developers in the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing technology.
