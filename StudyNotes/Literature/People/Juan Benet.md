Juan Benet (full name: Juan Benet i Vil√†) was a Spanish-American computer scientist, entrepreneur, and founder of the decentralized storage platform called Filecoin. He was born on April 18, 1989, in Barcelona, Spain and passed away on June 7, 2020.

Benet completed his bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Stanford University in 2010. During his time at Stanford, he conducted research on distributed systems and peer-to-peer networks. He then pursued a master's degree in Computer Science at the same institution.
