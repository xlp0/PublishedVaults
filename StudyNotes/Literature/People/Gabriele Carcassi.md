Gabriele Carcassi is a research specialist at the University of Michigan[staff](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/staff/carcassi.html)[1](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/staff/carcassi.html). He is known for his work in the field of physics, particularly in quantum mechanics[(PhysRev)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402)[2](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402).

One of his notable works includes a paper titled “Four Postulates of Quantum Mechanics Are Three,” which he co-authored with Lorenzo Maccone and Christine A. [Aidala](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402)[2](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402). In this paper, they proposed a way to reduce the number of postulates necessary to quantum mechanics[(3)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402)[2](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.110402).

Carcassi’s research aims to rederive the basic laws of physics from a handful of physical ideas. His work contributes significantly to our understanding of the fundamental principles of physics. He and [[Christine A. Aidala]] wrote a book called: [[Assumption of Physics]]. He also has a website called: [Assumptions of Physics](https://assumptionsofphysics.org/). This website has many links to a significant amount of content that deserves a Canvas all by itself.
