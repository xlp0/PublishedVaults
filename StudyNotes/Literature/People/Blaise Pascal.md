Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and philosopher who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his contributions to mathematics and his invention of the mechanical calculator called the Pascaline.

In terms of his relations with [[Ren√© Descartes]], Pascal was influenced by Descartes' philosophy and mathematical ideas. However, Pascal had some criticisms of Descartes' rationalism and believed that reason alone could not provide complete knowledge. Pascal emphasized the importance of both reason and faith in understanding the world.

[[Antoine Arnauld]] was a French theologian and philosopher who was a close friend and collaborator of Pascal. They worked together on religious matters, particularly defending Jansenism, a religious movement that emphasized predestination and divine grace. Arnauld was a prominent figure in the Jansenist movement, and Pascal supported him in their theological debates with the Jesuits. They exchanged numerous letters discussing theological matters, which were later published as "The Letters of Provincial."

# Conclusion

Overall, Pascal had intellectual connections with both Descartes and Arnauld but had different relationships with each. While he admired Descartes' ideas to some extent but also had reservations about them, he had a close friendship and collaboration with Arnauld on religious matters.
