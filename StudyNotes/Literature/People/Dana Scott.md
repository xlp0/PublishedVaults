Dana Scott, born as Dana Stewart Scott on October 11, 1932, is an American mathematician and computer scientist. He is best known for his work in the field of theoretical computer science, specifically in formal logic and semantics.

Scott received his Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1954. He then went on to obtain his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1958. After completing his studies, he joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley as a professor of mathematics.

In the early 1960s, Scott made significant contributions to the field of mathematical logic by developing a new branch called domain theory. This theory provides a mathematical foundation for denotational semantics, which is a method for describing the meaning of programming languages.

Scott's most notable achievement came in collaboration with [[Christopher Strachey]] when they introduced the concept of [[Denotational Semantics|denotational semantics]] in 1969. This approach revolutionized the understanding of programming languages and provided a rigorous mathematical framework for reasoning about their behavior.

Throughout his career, Scott received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to computer science and mathematics. In 1976, he was awarded the Turing Award, considered one of the highest honors in computer science. He was also elected as a fellow by various prestigious organizations including the Royal Society (UK), National Academy of Sciences (US), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Dana Scott has had a significant impact on both academia and industry through his pioneering work in theoretical computer science. His research has influenced various aspects of computing systems design and programming language semantics. Today, he continues to be actively involved in research and serves as an emeritus professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
