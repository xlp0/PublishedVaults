Dr. John N. Shutt is a computer science researcher who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Ultimate Abstraction. His thesis, titled "Fexprs as the basis of Lisp function application; or, $vau: the ultimate abstraction", was published in 2010.

In his thesis, Shutt argues that fexprs, a type of expression in the Lisp programming language, can be used to implement the ultimate abstraction. An ultimate abstraction is a programming language construct that can be used to represent any other programming language construct.

Shutt's work has been cited by other researchers in the field of computer science. His thesis is considered to be a significant contribution to the study of abstraction in programming languages.

Here are some other details about Dr. John N. Shutt:

- He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2010.
- He is currently a research scientist at Google AI.
- His research interests include programming languages, compilers, and artificial intelligence.
- He is the author of several papers published in top academic conferences and journals.
