Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) was a German mathematician, logician, and philosopher who is considered one of the founding figures of analytic philosophy. He made significant contributions to various fields, particularly in the areas of logic and the philosophy of language.

Frege's most influential work is his book "The Foundations of Arithmetic" (1884), in which he attempted to establish arithmetic as a branch of logic. He developed a formal system known as [[Predicate Calculus|predicate logic]], which provided a logical foundation for mathematics and revolutionized the study of [[Logic|logic]] itself. Frege's logical notation and concepts have had a lasting impact on the field.

One of Frege's most famous ideas is his distinction between sense (Sinn) and reference (Bedeutung). According to him, words and expressions have both a sense that conveys their meaning and a reference that points to an object in the world. This distinction laid the groundwork for later theories of meaning and reference in philosophy of language.

Frege also developed a theory of truth, arguing that sentences express propositions that can be either true or false depending on whether they correspond to facts in the world. His theory had an important influence on subsequent discussions about truth and semantics.

Despite his significant contributions to mathematics and logic, Frege's work did not receive much recognition during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his ideas gained wider attention and appreciation. Today, he is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of [[analytic philosophy]] and has influenced numerous philosophers, logicians, and mathematicians.
