Rajratna Ambedkar, also known as Rajratna Bhimrao Ambedkar, was an Indian social activist and politician. He was born on April 14, 1891, in the city of Mhow in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India. Rajratna Ambedkar is best known for his contributions to the upliftment and empowerment of the marginalized Dalit community in India.

Ambedkar belonged to the Dalit community himself, which historically faced severe social discrimination and oppression in Indian society. Despite facing numerous challenges and obstacles due to his caste, he pursued education and became one of the most educated individuals of his time.

Ambedkar played a significant role in drafting and shaping the Constitution of India after its independence from British colonial rule. He advocated for equal rights and opportunities for all citizens, irrespective of their caste or social background. His efforts were instrumental in securing various provisions within the Constitution that aimed at eliminating social inequality and discrimination.

Apart from his political contributions, Ambedkar also worked tirelessly to eradicate caste-based discrimination and promote social justice. He established several organizations and initiatives for the welfare of Dalits, including the Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha (Outcastes Welfare Association) and the Scheduled Castes Federation.

Rajratna Ambedkar's relentless efforts have made him an iconic figure not only among Dalits but also among social reformers worldwide. His teachings continue to inspire millions of people to fight against discrimination and work towards a more inclusive society.
