[[Rhadia Cousot]] is a computer scientist who, along with her husband [[Patrick Cousot]], has made significant contributions to the development and advancement of abstract interpretation. They are considered the pioneers of abstract interpretation, having introduced the concept and its fundamental principles in the late 1970s.

Together, Patrick and Radhia Cousot formulated the theoretical framework of abstract interpretation, which provides a foundation for static program analysis and verification. They developed techniques for abstracting the semantics of programs, defining abstract domains, and designing sound approximation methods. Their work has had a profound impact on the field of program analysis, influencing numerous subsequent research efforts and practical applications.

The Cousots' contributions have been recognized with various honors and awards. Patrick Cousot has received prestigious accolades, including the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award, the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, and the Turing Award (also known as the Nobel Prize of Computing) in 2013, jointly with Radhia Cousot.
