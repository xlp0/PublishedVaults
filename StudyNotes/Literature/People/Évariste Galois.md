[[Évariste Galois]] was a French mathematician born on October 25, 1811, in Bourg-la-Reine, France. He is considered one of the most influential mathematicians in history, despite his short life and tragic death at the age of 20.

Galois developed a keen interest in mathematics from a young age and showed exceptional mathematical talent. He made significant contributions to several branches of mathematics but is most famous for his work in algebra and number theory.

Galois was particularly interested in solving polynomial equations using radicals. He developed a theory known as Galois theory, which provided a new perspective on the solvability of equations through radicals. This theory revolutionized algebra and laid the foundation for many subsequent developments.

His work on [[Galois theory]] involved studying the properties of polynomial equations and their solutions by analyzing their symmetry. Galois proved that there are certain types of equations that cannot be solved using radicals, which led to a deeper understanding of the limitations of algebraic methods.

In addition to Galois theory, he made significant contributions to other areas such as [[Group theory|group theory]] and abstract algebra. His ideas greatly influenced the development of modern algebraic structures and had a profound impact on various fields of mathematics.

## Galois and Quintic Equation

Galois Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of field extensions, which are algebraic structures used to extend the real numbers or rational numbers to include new elements. This theory was developed by Évariste Galois in the early 19th century.

One of the main objectives of Galois Theory is to understand the solvability of polynomial equations using radicals. A polynomial equation is said to be solvable by radicals if its roots can be expressed using a combination of basic arithmetic operations and taking nth roots. For example, quadratic and cubic equations can always be solved by radicals.

However, there is a fundamental result in Galois Theory known as the Abel-Ruffini theorem, which states that there is no general formula for solving quintic (degree 5) and higher degree polynomial equations using only radicals. In other words, there isn't a formula that can express all the roots of a quintic equation solely in terms of arithmetic operations and taking nth roots.

This result was a significant discovery because it showed that not all polynomial equations can be solved algebraically. It led to the development of Galois Theory, which provides a framework for understanding why certain equations are not solvable by radicals.

Galois Theory studies the symmetries and structure of field extensions, particularly focusing on studying groups associated with these extensions called Galois groups. These groups provide information about how roots permute under various algebraic operations.

By analyzing these Galois groups, Galois Theory allows us to determine whether a given polynomial equation is solvable by radicals or not. If the Galois group associated with an equation is what is called "solvable," then it implies that the equation can be solved by radicals. On the other hand, if the Galois group is "unsolvable," then it proves that there exists no general formula involving only radicals for solving that particular equation.

Galois Theory provides insights into the solvability of polynomial equations, particularly the impossibility of solving quintic equations by radicals. It offers a deep understanding of the symmetries and structure underlying field extensions, leading to a rich area of mathematical research with applications in various fields such as number theory, algebraic geometry, and physics.

## Galois early death
Unfortunately, Galois' life was marked by personal struggles and political involvement. He was an active participant in the political unrest during his time, particularly during the July Revolution of 1830. His radical political views led to his arrest multiple times.

Tragically, at the age of 20, Galois died from wounds sustained in a duel over a romantic dispute. Despite his untimely death, his mathematical work continued to gain recognition after his passing. Mathematicians like Joseph-Louis Liouville and Camille Jordan recognized the significance of Galois' ideas and worked towards popularizing them.

# Conclusion
Today, Évariste Galois is celebrated as one of the great mathematicians who laid down the foundations of modern algebra. His work has inspired generations of mathematicians and continues to be studied and developed in various branches of mathematics. Galois theory remains a fundamental concept in algebra and is widely used in fields such as physics, computer science, and cryptography.
