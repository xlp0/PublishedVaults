[[Judea Pearl]] is a prominent computer scientist and philosopher known for his groundbreaking work in the field of causal inference and the development of graphical models for understanding [[causation|causal relationships]]. He was born on September 4, 1936, in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Pearl received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology in 1960. He then pursued his graduate studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now part of New York University), where he obtained his Master's degree in 1961 and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1965.

Throughout his career, Pearl has made significant contributions to several areas, including artificial intelligence, statistics, cognitive science, and philosophy. His work has had a profound impact on the fields of causality, reasoning under uncertainty, and probabilistic graphical models.

One of Pearl's major contributions is the development of Bayesian networks and causal Bayesian networks, which are graphical models that capture the causal relationships among variables and allow for probabilistic reasoning. These models provide a structured framework for representing, reasoning about, and learning from complex, uncertain, and causal systems.

Pearl's work also includes the development of the do-calculus, a set of mathematical rules and algorithms for causal inference from observational and interventional data. The do-calculus enables researchers to reason about counterfactuals and estimate causal effects, even in the presence of confounding variables.

His book "Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference," published in 2000, is considered a seminal work in the field and has become a standard reference for researchers studying causality.

Judea Pearl has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, including the Turing Award in 2011, which is one of the highest honors in the field. He is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Pearl continues to be actively involved in research and education as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he holds the title of Chancellor's Professor of Computer Science and Statistics and is the director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory.

Judea Pearl's work has had a profound influence on the field of causal inference, providing a solid theoretical foundation and practical tools for understanding and reasoning about [[causation|cause and effect relationships]]. His contributions have advanced our understanding of complex systems and have had significant applications in various fields, including medicine, economics, social sciences, and machine learning.
