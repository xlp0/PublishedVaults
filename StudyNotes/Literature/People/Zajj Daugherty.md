Prof. Zajj Daugherty is a Professor of Mathematics at City College of New York and teaching at at Reed College from 2022 to 2023. On her page at Reed College, her research interests are:

> My mathematical interests include [representation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_symmetric_group), [combinatorics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), [centralizer algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur-Weyl_duality), [Lie algebras and quantum groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_theory), [symmetric functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_functions), [partition algebras](http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+EXACT+partition_algebra/0/1/0/all/0/1), Hecke algebras, [BMW algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birman%E2%80%93Wenzl_algebra), and other amazing quotients of [braid algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_braid_group).
> I work mainly in combinatorial representation theory. Specifically, I study how combinatorial objects (like partitions, tableaux, lattices, etc.) encode structure of algebras similar to the group algebra of the symmetric group, Brauer algebras, graded and affine Temperley-Lieb, Hecke, and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras, etc.. My thesis work, completed in 2010 at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, began the study of two-boundary Hecke algebras.
