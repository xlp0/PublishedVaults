Donald Hoffman is a cognitive scientist and professor at the University of California, Irvine. He is known for his research on perception, [[Consciousness]], and the evolution of the mind.

Hoffman received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1975. He then pursued his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at MIT and completed it in 1983.

His main area of research revolves around understanding the nature of perception and how it shapes our experience of reality. Hoffman proposes that our perceptions are not a direct representation of the external world but rather a constructed model created by our brain to aid in survival. He also develop a notion called [[Conscious Agency]]. While being a professor of cognitive science at the University of California, Irvine. He has proposed a theory called "[[Conscious Realism]]" that challenges our traditional understanding of consciousness and agency.

He has developed a theoretical framework called "Interface Theory of Perception" which suggests that our perceptions are shaped by evolutionary pressures rather than directly reflecting the true nature of reality. According to this theory, our senses provide us with a simplified interface to navigate and survive in the world, rather than an accurate depiction of what exists outside our minds.

Hoffman's work challenges traditional notions of perception and suggests that much of what we perceive as reality is a product of our evolved cognitive processes. He argues that these processes prioritize survival over accurately representing objective reality.

Apart from his research, Hoffman is also involved in public outreach and has given numerous talks on consciousness and perception. He has published several articles in scientific journals and has received recognition for his contributions to cognitive science.

Overall, Donald Hoffman's work as a cognitive scientist focuses on understanding how perception shapes our understanding of reality, challenging traditional views on consciousness, and providing new insights into the nature of human cognition.
