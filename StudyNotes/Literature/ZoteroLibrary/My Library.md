#zotero 

The term "My Library" Is a folder reserved in the [[Zotero]] bibliographic management software to capture referenced content material. It can be mapped onto the [[Literature]] folder of [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]. It is designed to help users [[Convergence|converge]] onto a common namespace for managing data content.

[[My Library]] -> [[Literature]] which is the [[Convergence]] stage in [[XLP]]
