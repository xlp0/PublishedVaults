[[Duplicated Items]] is the [[Hub]] in [[Zettlekasten]], and it the [[Fail Early Fail Safe]] in [[XLP]].

## Duplicate Items as a Hub

The notion of [[Duplicated Items]] is that data that are drawn from all possible places are naturally going to be duplicated. Therefore, it is necessary to be automatically identified using some computational means. In this case, [[Zotero]] automatically identifies the duplicate items and put them into a single directory to be sorted out later. This is similar to the [[Hub]] function in [[Zettlekasten Workflow]], and it needs to be quickly identified in the [[Fail Early Fail Safe]] stage in [[XLP]].
