		"abstract": "The aim of this research is to design an executable meta-language that supports system architects’ modeling process by automating certain model construction, manipulation and simulation tasks. This language specifically addresses the needs in systematically communicating architects’ intent with a wide range of stakeholders and to organize knowledge from various domains. Our investigation into existing architecting approaches and technologies has pointed out the need to develop a simple and intuitive, yet formal language, that expresses multiple layers of abstractions, provides reflexive knowledge about the models, mechanizes data exchange and manipulation, while allowing integration with legacy infrastructures. A small set of linguistic primitives, stateful objects and processes that transform them were identified as both required and sufficient building blocks of the meta-language, specified as an Object-Process Network (OPN). To demonstrate the applicability of OPN, a software environment has been developed and applied to define meta-models of large-scale complex system architectures such as space transportation systems.",

One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers\". The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and other knowledge workers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking technique: the Zettelkasten. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for your notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. Dr. Sönke Ahrens is a writer and researcher in the field of education and social science. He is the author of the award-winning book “Experiment and Exploration: Forms of World Disclosure” (Springer). Since its first publication, How to Take Smart Notes has sold more than 100,000 copies and has been translated into seven languages",

It is based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory. It touches on topics as seemingly distant as the homotopy groups of spheres, the algorithms for type checking, and the definition of weak ∞-groupoids. Homotopy type theory offers a new “univalent” foundation of mathematics, in which a central role is played by Voevodsky’s univalence axiom and higher inductive types. The present book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of univalent foundations, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning — but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant. We believe that univalent foundations will eventually become a viable alternative to set theory as the “implicit foundation” for the unformalized mathematics done by most mathematicians.",

During this period, work with infectious agents produced only meager results which seemed irrelevant to humans. Then in the 1980s ground breaking evidence began to emerge that a variety of viruses also cause cancer in humans. There is now sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpes virus 8 according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Many other causes of cancer have also been identified by the IARC, which include: Sunlight, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, hormones, alcohol, parasites, fungi, bacteria, salted fish, wood dust, and herbs. The World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research have determined additional causes of cancer, which include beta carotene, red meat, processed meats, low fibre diets, not breast feeding, obesity, increased adult height and sedentary lifestyles. In brief, a historical review of the discoveries of the causes of human cancer is presented with extended discussions of the difficulties encountered in identifying viral causes of cancer.",

A case study of the Apollo lunar landing mission design is developed using this algebraic modeling approach.",

		"abstract": "The desire to fit in is one of the most powerful, least understood forces in a society. Todd Rose believes that as human beings we continually act against our own best interests out of our brains' misunderstanding of what we think others believe. A complicated set of illusions driven by conformity bias distorts how we see the world around us. From toilet paper shortages to kidneys that get thrown away rather than used for desperately needed organ transplants, from racial segregation to the perceived \"electability\" of women for political office, from bottled water to \"cancel culture,\" we routinely copy others, lie about what we believe, cling to tribes, and silence others. We are so profoundly social that when we are incongruent with the group that we do lasting damage to our self-worth, diminish our well-being and never realize our full potential. It's why we all too often chase the familiar trappings of money, fame, and success that leave us feeling empty even when we do achieve them. It's why we'll blindly espouse a viewpoint we don't necessarily believe in so that we blend in with the group. We trap ourselves in prisons of our own making that prevent us from living the happy, fulfilled lives we envision. The question is, Why do we keep believing the lies and hurting ourselves? Todd Rose reveals the answer is deeply hard-wired in our DNA, with brains that are more socially dependent than we realize or dare to accept. Most of us would rather be fully in sync with the social norms of our respective groups than true to who we are. Using originally researched data, \"Collective Illusions\" shows us where we get things wrong and just as important, how we can be authentic in forming our opinions while valuing truth. Rose offers a counterintuitive, empowering, and hopeful explanation for how we can bridge the inference gap, make decisions with a newfound clarity, and achieve fulfillment. Only then can we transform ourselves, and ultimately, society",

This paper applied this framework to assess an XLP session done at Tsinghua University. The results showed that participants who are more involved in digital publishing are more reputable and productive among fellow participants.",

		"abstract": "When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a particular prob- lem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of a number of good text- books or handbooks. Unfortunately, programmers in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have this luxury. Although some data struc- tures designed for imperative languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on as- signments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in functional languages. To address this imbalance, we describe several techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient catena- tion.\nIn addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in amortized functional data structures. Traditional methods of amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not just the most recent, are available for further processing. This property is known as persistence, and is taken for granted in functional languages. On the surface, persistence and amortization appear to be incompatible, but we show how lazy evaluation can be used to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are efficient even when used persistently. Turning this relationship between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of amortization also provides the first practical techniques for analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs.\nFinally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming language de- signers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive modules.",

He shows how variations on these basic problems lead directly to the frontiers of current mathematical research and offers ten accessible unsolved problems for the enterprising reader.

Using 235 hand-drawn diagrams, Needham deploys Newton's geometrical methods to provide geometrical explanations of the classical results. In the fifth act, he offers the first undergraduate introduction to differential forms that treats advanced topics in an intuitive and geometrical manner. Unique features of the first four acts include: four distinct geometrical proofs of the fundamentally important Global Gauss-Bonnet theorem, providing a stunning link between local geometry and global topology; a simple, geometrical proof of Gauss's famous Theorema Egregium; a complete geometrical treatment of the Riemann curvature tensor of an n-manifold; and a detailed geometrical treatment of Einstein's field equation, describing gravity as curved spacetime (General Relativity), together with its implications for gravitational waves, black holes, and cosmology. The final act elucidates such topics as the unification of all the integral theorems of vector calculus; the elegant reformulation of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism in terms of 2-forms; de Rham cohomology; differential geometry via Cartan's method of moving frames; and the calculation of the Riemann tensor using curvature 2-forms. Six of the seven chapters of Act V can be read completely independently from the rest of the book\"--",

		"abstract": "Abstraction creates custom programming languages that facilitate programming for\nspecific problem domains. It is traditionally partitioned according to a two-phase\nmodel of program evaluation, into syntactic abstraction enacted at translation time,\nand semantic abstraction enacted at run time. Abstractions pigeon-holed into one\nphase cannot interact freely with those in the other, since they are required to occur\nat logically distinct times.\nFexprs are a Lisp device that subsumes the capabilities of syntactic abstraction,\nbut is enacted at run-time, thus eliminating the phase barrier between abstractions.\nLisps of recent decades have avoided fexprs because of semantic ill-behavedness that\naccompanied fexprs in the dynamically scoped Lisps of the 1960s and 70s.\nThis dissertation contends that the severe difficulties attendant on fexprs in the\npast are not essential, and can be overcome by judicious coordination with other\nelements of language design. In particular, fexprs can form the basis for a simple, well-\nbehaved Scheme-like language, subsuming traditional abstractions without a multi-\nphase model of evaluation.\nThe thesis is supported by a new Scheme-like language called Kernel, created\nfor this work, in which each Scheme-style procedure consists of a wrapper that in-\nduces evaluation of operands, around a fexpr that acts on the resulting arguments.\nThis arrangement enables Kernel to use a simple direct style of selectively evaluat-\ning subexpressions, in place of most Lisps’ indirect quasiquotation style of selectively\nsuppressing subexpression evaluation. The semantics of Kernel are treated through\na new family of formal calculi, introduced here, called vau calculi. Vau calculi use\ndirect subexpression-evaluation style to extend lambda calculus, eliminating a long-\nstanding incompatibility between lambda calculus and fexprs that would otherwise\ntrivialize their equational theories.\nThe impure vau calculi introduce non-functional binding constructs and unconven-\ntional forms of substitution. This strategy avoids a difficulty of Felleisen’s lambda-v-\nCS calculus, which modeled impure control and state using a partially non-compatible\nreduction relation, and therefore only approximated the Church–Rosser and Plotkin’s\nCorrespondence Theorems. The strategy here is supported by an abstract class of\nRegular Substitutive Reduction Systems, generalizing Klop’s Regular Combinatory\nReduction Systems.",

We had a great time getting educated on the topic, both Professors have a great sense of humours and we had some interruption, some drama but a lot of fun moments too. Wonderful time well spent! \n\nTopic of discussion: Conscious Agency/Cognitive Agency\n\nThe view in our cognitive scientists today is that we construct our perception of reality in real time. The questions was, could we be misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences? And What is our current understanding in the biology of science? \n\nAccording to evolution, what we perceive with our brain and our senses does not reflect the true nature of the reality. Why should you care? The implications of such radical finding rock the foundation of our belief systems that space-time is fundamental.  \n\nTimecodes\n00:00 - Intro\n01:28 - Any new project for 2023?\n01:29 - Levin on his outstanding long list of project \n02:33 - Ivy and Don were shock with Levin’s list, very impressive!\n02:39 - Don on new up coming new paper - Look out for it!\n03:09 - Don is looking on a dynamic and he speak on the insight\n05:41 - Ivy’s on Levin’s tweets - find out what it is!\n06:23 - Ivy’s ask about the toy that missing \n06:30 - Levin on his childhood memory\n07:33 - Levin on the notion of selfhood\n09:10 - Levin on what’s he meant on ”illusory self”\n12:07 - Is space-time a data structure?\n12:20 - Don on time and space \n17:33 - Levin on the profound idea of space-time\n21:41 - Summarising Don’s model from an autistic point of view (shocker!)\n22:07 - Its raving BONKER \n22:12 - Has that view change your life? \n22:23 - Don on realisation of the reality has yet to sunk it, slow process\n26:14 - We’re programmed at the stage since we're 3 months old baby\n26:40 - Levin on a lunch debate with a friend on free will (funny moment!)\n28:18 - Levin on two side of the common conditioning Experience vs Memory \n31:12 - Dinosaur is not real?

		"abstract": "From the Publisher: Should cyberspace be regulated__ __ How can it be done__ __ It's a cherished belief of techies and net denizens everywhere that cyberspace is fundamentally impossible to regulate. Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig warns that, if we're not careful we'll wake up one day to discover that the character of cyberspace has changed from under us. Cyberspace will no longer be a world of relative freedom; instead it will be a world of perfect control where our identities, actions, and desires are monitored, tracked, and analyzed for the latest market research report. Commercial forces will dictate the change, and architecture—the very structure of cyberspace itself—will dictate the form our interactions can and cannot take. Code And Other Laws of Cyberspace is an exciting examination of how the core values of cyberspace as we know it—intellectual property, free speech, and privacy-—are being threatened and what we can do to protect them. Lessig shows how code—the architecture and law of cyberspace—can make a domain, site, or network free or restrictive; how technological architectures influence people's behavior and the values they adopt; and how changes in code can have damaging consequences for individual freedoms. Code is not just for lawyers and policymakers; it is a must-read for everyone concerned with survival of democratic values in the Information Age.",

		"abstract": "Programming languages providing high-level abstractions can increase programmers’ productivity and program safety. Language-oriented programming is a paradigm in which domain-specific languages are developed to solve problems within specific domains with (high-level) abstractions relevant to those domains. However, language development involves complex design and engineering processes. These processes can be simplified by reusing (parts of) existing languages and by offering language-parametric tooling. In this paper we present iCoLa, a meta-language supporting incremental (meta-)programming based on reusable components. In our implementation of iCoLa, languages are first-class citizens, providing the full power of the host-language (Haskell) to compose and manipulate languages. We demonstrate iCoLa through the construction of the Imp, SIMPLE, and MiniJava languages via the composition and restriction of language fragments and demonstrate the variability of our approach through the construction of several languages using a fixed-set of operators.",

		"abstract": "Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: Consciousness is often seen as requiring a special kind of explanation. But the various aspects of self-awareness can presumably emerge when certain levels of complexity are reached in an organism: it is not necessary to assume additional mechanisms or hidden causes. Looking at the most fundamental level, that of elementary particle physics, three principles appear—the conformability of nature to herself, the applicability of the criterion of simplicity, and the utility of certain parts of mathematics in describing physical reality—which are in themselves emergent properties of the fundamental laws of physics. At successive levels, it is the availability of similar mathematical descriptions from related problems that makes the next step appear with simplicity and elegance. Thus, once the concept of emergence is properly established, a huge burden is lifted from the inquiring mind. The whole explanatory loop may be closed by looking at the ability of the human mind to figure out the laws of nature. All the other sciences emerge in principle from fundamental physics plus historical accidents, even though “reduction” is obviously inadequate as a strategy. While bridges or staircases are under construction connecting the various sciences, each science needs to be studied at its own level as well. Although the idea of “vital forces” in biology alien to physics and chemistry has largely disappeared, consciousness remains the last refuge of obscurantists. Finally, it is argued that appeals to the alleged weirdness of quantum mechanics are based on a misunderstanding and are unlikely to have any place in a discussion of consciousness.",

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.",

In the last 30 years, there has been a renaissance of combinatorics, especially what is called enumerative, algebraic and bijective combinatorics. Powerful combinatorial tools have been discovered, in relation with other domains of pure mathematics, and such tools appear to be useful for theoretical physics.\n\nWith some examples I will illustrate this fruitful interaction between combinatorics and physics, giving rise to a domain which can be called \"Combinatorial Physics''. A new journal is born \"Combinatorics, Physics and their Interactions'' in the prestigious series of the Annales of Poincare Institute in Paris. On the front page one can read \"The unfolding of new ideas in physics is often tied to the development of new combinatorial methods, and conversely some problems in combinatorics have been successfully attacked using methods inspired by statistical physics or quantum field theory\".",

We here suggest the possibility of combining simulation features of an executable meta-language called Object-Process Network (OPN) with the descriptive power of well-known modeling languages such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM), Structured Analysis (SA) or SysML. In the Systems Architecture domain, a great issue one always faces is the great number of options to be considered when designing a system. We must keep in mind that modeling the space of options is actually different from modeling the system of interest. The traditional modeling tools allow us to specify a unique solution, when we should consider the whole set of feasible architectures. On the other hand, OPN is able to help architects to assess all these possible configurations but, as a decision-support tool, it doesn’t offer the descriptive power OPM, SA and SysML do.",

		"abstract": "One the most difficult aspects of system conceptualization process is to recognize, understand and manage the trade-offs in a way that maximizes the success of the product. This is particularly important for space projects. In this way, a major part of the system engineer’s role is to provide information that the system manager can use to make the right decisions. This includes identification of alternative architectures and characterization of those elements in a way that helps managers to find out, among the alternatives, a design that provides a better combination of the various technical areas involved in the design. Space mission architecture consists of a broad system concept which is the most fundamental statement of how the mission will be carried out and satisfy the stakeholders. The architecture development process starts with the stakeholder analysis which enables the identification of the decision drivers, then, the requirements are analysed for elaborationg the system concept. Effectiveness parameters such as performance, cost, risk and schedule are the outcomes of the stakeholder analysis which are labelled as decision drivers to be used in a trade off process to improve the managerial mission decisions. Thus, the proposal presented herein provides a means for innovating the mission design process by identifying drivers through stakeholder analysis and use them in a trade off process to obtain the stakeholder satisfaction with effectiveness parameters.",

Therefore, having a rigorous approach and supporting tools to identify and filter a development portfolio at the early stages can be highly rewarding. This paper presents an executable specification language, Object-Process Network (OPN), that can be used by system designers to formally represent the development option space, and automate certain model refinement activities at earlier phases of product development. Specifically, an OPN specification model can automatically enumerate a set of alternative development portfolios. OPN also provides an algebraic mechanism to handle the knowledge incompleteness problems at varying phases of planning, so that uncertain properties of different portfolios can be represented and analyzed under algebraic principles.",

Learning causality can be challenging, but it offers distinct advantages that elude a purely statistical mindset. Causal Inference and Discovery in Python helps you unlock the potential of causality.You'll start with basic motivations behind causal thinking and a comprehensive introduction to Pearlian causal concepts, such as structural causal models, interventions, counterfactuals, and more. Each concept is accompanied by a theoretical explanation and a set of practical exercises with Python code.Next, you'll dive into the world of causal effect estimation, consistently progressing towards modern machine learning methods. Step-by-step, you'll discover Python causal ecosystem and harness the power of cutting-edge algorithms. You'll further explore the mechanics of how “causes leave traces” and compare the main families of causal discovery algorithms.The final chapter gives you a broad outlook into the future of causal AI where we examine challenges and opportunities and provide you with a comprehensive list of resources to learn more.What you will learnMaster the fundamental concepts of causal inferenceDecipher the mysteries of structural causal modelsUnleash the power of the 4-step causal inference process in PythonExplore advanced uplift modeling techniquesUnlock the secrets of modern causal discovery using PythonUse causal inference for social impact and community benefitWho this book is forThis book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and machine learning researchers looking to extend their data science toolkit and explore causal machine learning. It will also help developers familiar with causality who have worked in another technology and want to switch to Python, and data scientists with a history of working with traditional causality who want to learn causal machine learning. It's also a must-read for tech-savvy entrepreneurs looking to build a competitive edge for their products and go beyond the limitations of traditional machine learning.Table of ContentsCausality – Hey, We Have Machine Learning, So Why Even Bother?Judea Pearl and the Ladder of CausationRegression, Observations, and InterventionsGraphical ModelsForks, Chains, and ImmoralitiesNodes, Edges, and Statistical (In)dependenceThe Four-Step Process of Causal InferenceCausal Models – Assumptions and ChallengesCausal Inference and Machine Learning – from Matching to Meta-LearnersCausal Inference and Machine Learning – Advanced Estimators, Experiments, Evaluations, and MoreCausal Inference and Machine Learning – Deep Learning, NLP, and BeyondCan I Have a Causal Graph, Please?Causal Discovery and Machine Learning – from Assumptions to ApplicationsCausal Discovery and Machine Learning – Advanced Deep Learning and BeyondEpilogue",

		"abstract": "Many NLP tasks benefit from using large language models (LLMs) that often have more than 100 billion parameters. With the release of BLOOM-176B and OPT-175B, everyone can download pretrained models of this scale. Still, using these models requires high-end hardware unavailable to many researchers. In some cases, LLMs can be used more affordably via RAM offloading or hosted APIs. However, these techniques have innate limitations: offloading is too slow for interactive inference, while APIs are not flexible enough for research that requires access to weights, attention or logits. In this work, we propose Petals - a system for inference and fine-tuning of large models collaboratively by joining the resources of multiple parties. We demonstrate that this strategy outperforms offloading for very large models, running inference of BLOOM-176B on consumer GPUs with $\\approx$ 1 step per second, which is enough for many interactive LLM applications. Unlike most inference APIs, Petals also natively exposes hidden states of served models, allowing to train and share custom model extensions based on efficient fine-tuning methods.",

As always, I'll illustrate the concepts with live animations alongside the actual commands.\n\nWRITTEN ARTICLE & REFERENCE: https://www.themoderncoder.com/git-st...\nGIT STARTER GUIDES: https://www.themoderncoder.com/git/\n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Intro\n0:15 Git stash use-cases\n1:12 Git stash: basic example\n3:26 Multiple stashes & naming stashes\n5:16 Git stash branches\n6:00 Deleting stash entries\n6:20 Git stash merge conflicts\n\nMY TECH\n2020 M1 MacBook Air (I have the 512GB variant): https://amzn.to/3TTIBsE\nAirPods Pro: https://amzn.to/3sRLUo5\nChair: https://amzn.to/3zJI9Fa \nGaming headset: https://amzn.to/3zwbT8i \nHeadphones (newer model): https://amzn.to/3Ub5reT \nKeyboard: https://amzn.to/3FOOOC7\nMouse: https://amzn.to/3WhMFV9\nMonitor: https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/...\nMonitor arm (newer model): https://amzn.to/3gXnlUa \nWebcam: https://amzn.to/3zxxwp0\n\nTECH ACCESSORIES\nLaptop stand: https://amzn.to/3NuyqZ5\nMouse pad/mat: https://amzn.to/3U9QFVO \nKVM switch: https://amzn.to/3gZmpP0 \nPC case: https://amzn.to/3Fx4Hg5\nUnder desk drawer: https://amzn.to/3WloFAo\n\nVIDEO GEAR\nCamera: https://amzn.to/3WkbiRe \nLens: https://amzn.to/3zxiTC4 \nMicrophone: https://amzn.to/3SSUoWE \nMain key light: https://amzn.to/3WhZbny \nSecondary light: https://amzn.to/3fpRefx \n\nSome of the links above are affiliate links which means, at no extra cost to you, I will make a small commission if you click them and make a qualifying purchase.

		"abstract": "NASes are pricey but provide a level of robustness that a beefy external hard drive or cloud storage just don’t provide. In a NAS you can configure drives into an array, meaning drives can be combined to basically form a bigger super drive, by splitting the load of data across each of the drives, increasing the overall speed of the group, and using one drive as redundancy. So that if one drive fails, the whole thing doesn’t go kaput. So if we have more bays, we can consolidate more drives together to make even faster storage. \n\nAffiliate Links to Products Mentioned:\nSynology DS923+: https://amzn.to/3BZLFfn\n10GBe Module: https://amzn.to/3N0eiPL\nSynology DS1821+: https://amzn.to/428bapr\nDS1821+ 10GBe Module: https://amzn.to/42dgxUz\nUbiquiti Flex XG: https://amzn.to/3C6dTVH\nTP-Link 10GB Ethernet Pcie Card: https://amzn.to/3IInC8B\nSamsung 870 EVO 4TB: https://amzn.to/3N0EYQA\n\nAffiliate links to YouTube gear I use:\nSony a7siii: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1qb8i/\nSony A7c: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1qb8k/\n14in M1 Pro MacBook Pro: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1qb83/\nMac Studio: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1qb8o/\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:48 Current NAS Setup\n3:59 What Do I Use the NAS For?\n6:30 My Issues with it\n9:20 The Solutions\n13:40 What would I recommend?\n16:22 Conclusion\n\nSome NAS have multi-gig ethernet out of the box, but with our Synology box, we have to install this 10 gigabit ethernet card, giving us up to 1250MB/s per second of data, which is fast. But there’s a catch, to use 10 gigabit, everything between the NAS and your computer, has to be 10 gigabit. So this means the network switch and computer this NAS is connected to has to have a 10 gigabit ethernet port and support those speeds. 10 gigabit is expensive, and replacing everything around the NAS and computer to be 10 gigabit could add up fast. Network switches with 10 gigabit start around $300 for 4-5 ports, 10 gigabit pcie cards for your PC costs around $100, and for your Mac, you gotta have it selected when ordered, or pay $200 for a bulky dongle.\n\nA single NAS alone is not a back up solution, especially if it’s the only place I have my precious files on. For that, you’d want to follow the 3-2-1 rule of data back ups. Having 3 different copies, across 2 different types of devices, and 1 copy stored off site. Hard drives when paired together in raid, and all working together increases read and write speeds significantly, but a nas does not remove the Hard drive’s latency and poor random read and write performance. How long it takes to execute an action and find random files across a storage pool. Even a single SATA SSD is faster than 6 hard drives working together when it comes to random reads and writes. Video editing relies on a mixture of good sequential speeds, and good random speeds. With the 6 Hard Drives in SHR, opening folders and video project files took a few moments longer than if they were running off of my computer. So, really with this NAS I had 3 major issues with it. I’m not really following the best practices of 3-2-1 data backups, I’m running out of drive bays, and editing off of it, I introduced some annoying lag. How did I go about resolving these issues? Well, the first solution I thought of was to cut my losses, buy big jumbo sized hard drives, consolidate my data onto those drives and find a new purpose for those old hard drives. Then install an SSD into one of the drive bays, and use that for my video editing, and sync it to the big drives. Then I’d use a cloud storage provider, like backblaze to back up the whole NAS to the cloud. This would mean I could solve all of my issues. But cloud storage can get expensive fast. Then another solution appeared, why not add a new NAS, that will be all flash, nothing but SSDs to use as a nice, quiet and fast NAS dedicated to just my current video projects. And that’s what I ended up doing. \n\nWith this DS923+, I installed a 4TB SATA SSD. Which gives me plenty of space for video projects. By using such a large single SSD now, I can expand with other large SSDs when I need more space, or when video editing gets more intensive. So now I have a single small NAS for my current projects, a bigger nas for archiving purposes, some external hdds I’ve had laying around connected to that for another copy. While I keep these NASes in separate rooms, The really important stuff gets backed up to Backblaze, while less commonly touched files with lesser importance get updated on an external hard drive that I’ll store away.\n\nWith what I know now, what would I recommend for someone who’s looking at starting their own NAS journey? Get a good 4-6 Bay NAS and, splurge for 2 20TB drives run in SHR or Raid for redundancy and add more 20TB drives as needed. You could start off with just 1 20TB drive but you'll need a good backup solution in case it fails. So I’d really consider thinking ahead here and prioritize hard drive size over bigger NASes. It’s really my biggest regret.",

The goal is the development, initial application and distribution of an open source software system called Fab City OS (OS = Operating System) which can be implemented as a software stack along the value chain at the respective entities of the global network, e.g. Fab Cities, Fab Labs to build up and run a local and yet globally connected value creation system.\n\nKey Principles\n\nWe strongly believe in the power of Open Source and thus apply corresponding licensing regimes to all of our software and hardware developments and applications. As a result, a digital commons is created - a public, non-exclusive good. Another key concept is federation in the sense that we build a digital infrastructure that can be hosted individually and independently by a Fab City while being able to connect and exchange data with other Fab Cities. Finally, we make use of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and crypto functions to enable secure transactions among the network.\n\nVideo Credits:\n\nExecutive Producer: INTERFACER PROJECT\nWriter: Raphael Haus\nCo-Writer: Jaromil, Mihaela Tudorache\nProducer: Raphael Haus, Oliver Schwartz\nProduction: Wolke7.tv\nNarrator Voice: Cari Souter\n\nProduction Sites: Fabulous St.Pauli, Insel e.V. offene Recycling Werkstatt, XYZ Cargo Bikes, Curious Community Lab\n\nFurther Supporters: House of All (textiles), InMachines GmbH (Open Source Hardware Machines)\n\nFab Conference Footage was provided by Fab  Foundation\n\nCC Stokfootage Video Attribution from Pexels.com:\n- Tom Fisk: https://www.pexels.com/video/cargo-co...\n- Tom Fisk: https://www.pexels.com/video/a-hill-o...\n- Vladimir Koshenkov https://www.pexels.com/video/a-person...\n- cottonbro studio: https://www.pexels.com/cs-cz/video/mo...\n- Kevin Yau: https://www.pexels.com/video/people-w...\n- Karina Badura: https://www.pexels.com/video/a-st-pau...\n- Braeson Holland: https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-s...\n- cottonbro studio: https://www.pexels.com/video/people-w...\n- cottonbro studio: https://www.pexels.com/video/people-i...\n- wowi allinsky: https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-v...\n- Taryn Elliott: https://www.pexels.com/video/drone-fo...\n- brahim Bennett: https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-v...\n- Henry: https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-f...\n- Kindel Media: https://www.pexels.com/video/a-man-wo...\n- Kindel Media: https://www.pexels.com/video/people-s...\n- Mikhail Nilov: https://www.pexels.com/video/a-man-us...\n- Mikhail Nilov: https://www.pexels.com/video/person-i...",

A lightweight Qsync utility (available for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS) should be installed on these devices so they can communicate with the NAS for file sync tasks and ensure that up-to-date data is always available to you.In Qsync Central, you can configure management settings such as conflict policies and filter settings. Each device can have its own settings, or you can apply centralized settings to all devices. An optional password can be used to protect centralized settings. If you accidentally lose a connected device, a remote erase function is available to ensure that no one gets access to personal/organizational data.Download for Windows - https://download.qnap.com/Storage/Utility/QNAPQsyncClientWindows-4.5.1.1026.exeDownload for Mac OS - https://download.qnap.com/Storage/Utility/QNAPQsyncClientMac-3.6.0.1026.dmgDownload for Ubuntu - https://download.qnap.com/Storage/Utility/QNAPQsyncClientUbuntux64-1.0.5.0305.debFollow us on twitter - https://twitter.com/QNAP_nasLike us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/qnapuk/Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/qnap_uk/ Visit our website – https://www.qnap.com/en-ukTechnical Support (UK) - https://service.qnap.com/en-uk Product Compatibility - https://www.qnap.com/en-uk/compatibility/ Where to buy your QNAP NASAmazon - http://amzn.to/2NatDB7SPAN.com - http://bit.ly/3jwMmTq Broadbandbuyer - https://bit.ly/3cYo6bw Box.co.uk - http://bit.ly/2YZ5jVj Ebuyer - http://bit.ly/3oWMxZm",

The latest release in QNAP’s flagship series of Prosumer/SMB hardware, the TS-264 represents the most advanced iteration of this product line to date. This is to be expected, as advancements in hardware technology continually drive improvements in power, performance, and efficiency. The TS-264 stands out in particular for its evolutionary design and mature approach to hardware engineering, making it a noteworthy NAS to consider. Historically, QNAP has been a pioneer in the NAS hardware market, offering cutting-edge technology at a competitive value. The TS-264 series is notable for its exceptional scalability, with architecture that is unmatched in the industry. Despite the comprehensive OS-level platform, services, and applications offered through QTS, QNAP faced challenges in Jan 2022 when they were targeted by ransomware attacks via discovered Linux vulnerabilities, causing some concerns regarding platform security. However, with the latest release of QTS 5 and a large range of security improvements, safeguards, changes in system defaults and a more locked-down approach to platform management, QNAP aims to regain trust and move forward.\n\nVideo Chapters\n00:00 - The Start\n00:15 - What is Jellyfin?\n00:55 - Why is Installing Jellyfin as a Container Tough for Some Users?\n02:34 - The Best Jellyfin NAS Installer QNAP App\n06:41 - Important Disclaimer\n07:08 - How to Install the Jellyfin Installer QPKG\n08:41 - Initializing Jellfyfin on your QNAP NAS\n09:35 - Adding Libraries to Jellyfin for your Movies, TV, Music etc\n10:23 - Setting metadata Crawling Up in Jellyfin\n11:23 - An Important note about Remote Access to  Jellyfin on your QNAP NAS\n13:04 - DLNA Support in Jellyfin\n13:30 - Hardware Acceleration/Transcoding on Jellyfin on the QNAP NAS\n\nLooking for deals and offers on all things NAS, DAS, SSD, HDD and more?

		"abstract": "In this groundbreaking book, Leonard Shlain, author of the bestselling \"Art & Physics,\" proposes that the process of learning alphabetic literacy rewired the human brain, with profound consequences for culture. Making remarkable connections across a wide range of subjects including brain function, anthropology, history, and religion, Shlain argues that literacy reinforced the brain's linear, abstract, predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the holistic, iconic feminine right one. This shift upset the balance between men and women initiating the disappearance of goddesses, the abhorrence of images, and, in literacy's early stages, the decline of women's political status. Patriarchy and misogyny followed. \n \nwww.leonardshlain.com \n \nA lot of these ideas were explored in a film that his daughter Tiffany Shlain made in 2011. You can find out more about that film at www.connectedthefilm.com \n \nAbout Dr. Leonard Shlain: \n \nThe Bay Area and the world lost a renowned visionary thinker and educator when Leonard Shlain, best-selling author and San Francisco surgeon, died Monday, May 11, 2009 at his home in Mill Valley after a battle with brain cancer. He was 71 years old. \n \nAdmired among artists, scientists, philosophers, anthropologists and educators, Leonard Shlain authored three best-selling books: Art & Physics, Alphabet vs. The Goddess and Sex, Time, and Power. He delivered multimedia presentations based upon his books in venues around the world including Harvard, The New York Museum of Modern Art, CERN, Los Alamos, The Florence Academy of Art and the European Council of Ministers. His fans include Al Gore, Norman Lear and singer Bjork who credited Shlain 's Alphabet vs. The Goddess with inspiring her recent album \"Wanderlust\". His fourth book Leonardo's Brain about Leonardo Da Vinci will be published next spring by Viking. Dr. Shlain was a surgeon for 38 years at California Pacific Medical Center where he headed the Laparascopic Surgery Department and an Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at UCSF. \n \nLeonard Shlain was a loving and generous man with a larger-than-life intellect and a prodigious curiosity. He was a widely respected surgeon and attentive father and husband. He had an encyclopedic knowledge which he wove with highly creative insights in his books and presentations. A voracious reader, he took pride in finding the perfect metaphor and delighted in making connections between everything from art, physics, to human evolution and sexuality. Dinner conversations spanned from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to politics, literature to a hilarious joke. When his children were young, he brought a human brain in a bucket of formaldehyde during the school show and tell. When he came home after a hard day's work as a young surgeon, he would excitedly diagram his operation of the day on a napkin. Later, his diagrams became more adventuresome and expanded to thought experiments that included what it would be like to sit astride a beam of light and how that corresponded with Picasso's rose period, blue period. This eventually led him to write his first book, Art and Physics. \n \nLeonard Michael Shlain was born on August 28th, 1937 in Detroit Michigan. He graduated Central High School at the age of fifteen, attended University of Michigan and then graduated Wayne State University Medical School at twenty three (AOA), where he was recently honored as the alumnus of the year. After serving as a Captain in the U.S. Army stationed in France, he interned at Mt. Zion in San Francisco, began his surgical residency at Bellevue Hospital in New York and then completed it at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco where he set up his general surgical practice in 1969. In 1973, he volunteered and served as a trauma surgeon in Isreal during the Yom Kippur War. An early pioneer of gallbladder and hernia laparascopic surgery in 1990, he was flown around the world to train doctors in the new techniques, patented several surgical instruments and specialized in gallbladder and hernia operations.",

In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. \n\nDr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

There is a widespread belief that computing science has matured from a theoretical topic for scientist to a practical issue for engineers, managers and entrepreneurs. According to the author, computing's central challenge for smooth process has not yet been met. Most of the computer systems are complicated, messy and chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence. The unmastered complexity is at the root of the misery. The future of computer science depends on courage and imagination of scientists. The article suggests that scientists need not to blame the lack of education of an average engineer, the shortsightedness of managers, and the malice of the entrepreneurs for unsatisfactory services for the computer industry customers. The industry and scientists need to overcome problem created by bug-ridden software for future of the industry.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

Topological Deep Learning (TDL) provides a comprehensive framework to process and extract knowledge from data associated with these systems, such as predicting the social community to which an individual belongs or predicting whether a protein can be a reasonable target for drug development. TDL has demonstrated theoretical and practical advantages that hold the promise of breaking ground in the applied sciences and beyond. However, the rapid growth of the TDL literature has also led to a lack of unification in notation and language across Topological Neural Network (TNN) architectures. This presents a real obstacle for building upon existing works and for deploying TNNs to new real-world problems. To address this issue, we provide an accessible introduction to TDL, and compare the recently published TNNs using a unified mathematical and graphical notation. Through an intuitive and critical review of the emerging field of TDL, we extract valuable insights into current challenges and exciting opportunities for future development.",

Rezende\n\n87 minutes\nEnglish\nCategory: Machine learning\n\nAbstract\n\nThe study of symmetries in physics has revolutionized our understanding of the world. Inspired by this, the development of methods to incorporate internal (Gauge) and external (space-time) symmetries into machine learning models is a very active field of research. We will present our work on invariant generative models and its applications to lattice-QCD and molecular dynamics simulations. In the molecular dynamics front, we'll talk about how we constructed permutation and translation-invariant normalizing flows on a torus for free-energy estimation. In lattice-QCD, we'll present our work that introduced the first U(N) and SU(N) Gauge-equivariant normalizing flows for pure Gauge simulations and its extensions to incorporate fermions.\n\nSpeaker/s\n\nDanilo J. Rezende is a senior staff researcher and lead of the Generative Models and Inference group at DeepMind, London. For the past 12 years his research has focused on scalable inference and generative models applied to reinforcement learning, modelling of complex data such as medical images, videos, 3D scene geometry and complex physical systems. He has co-authored more than 90 papers and patents, amongst which a few highly cited papers on approximate inference and modelling with neural networks (such as deep latent gaussian models, normalizing flows and interaction networks). Highlights of his recent work at the intersection of AI and physics include equivariant normalizing flows for lattice-QCD and molecular dynamics. Rezende is engaged in promoting the alliance between ML/AI, physics, and geometry. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and an M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics from Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) and the Institute of Theoretical Physics (SP, Brazil). Once an aspiring Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the Centre de Physique Théorique in Marseille, France he switched to a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (Lausanne, Switzerland), where he studied computational/statistical models of learning and sensory fusion.\n\nModerator: MBZUAI’s Director of Center of Integrative Artificial Intelligence (CIAI) and Associate Professor, Kun Zhang",

AI-powered learning can provide millions of learners with personalized, active, and practical learning experiences, which are key to successful learning. This is especially relevant in the context of online learning platforms. In this talk, I will first present the Korbit Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), which provides a dialogue-based practical learning experience online. I will then describe the AI approaches that we use to provide learners on our platform with highly personalized and active learning experiences. Finally, I will present and discuss the results of a comparative head-to-head study on learning outcomes for Korbit and a popular MOOC platform that follows a traditional model delivering content using lecture videos and multiple-choice quizzes. Our experiments demonstrate a huge and statistically significant increase in learning outcomes, with students on the Korbit platform showing higher course completion rates and achieving learning gains two to 2.5 times higher than students on an online platform who do not receive personalized feedback. These results highlight the tremendous impact that can be achieved with an AI-powered system, making high-quality learning experiences available to millions of learners around the world.\n\nSpeaker/s\n\nEkaterina Kochmar is a lecturer (assistant professor) at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Bath, where she is part of the AI research group. She conducts research at the intersection of AI, natural language processing (NLP), and intelligent tutoring systems. \n\nPrior to that, she has been working as a post-doctoral researcher at the ALTA (Automated Language Teaching and Assessment) Institute, University of Cambridge, focusing on the development of educational applications for second language learners. Her research contributed to the building of Read & Improve, a readability tool for non-native readers of English. \n\nShe is also a co-founder and the chief scientific officer of Korbit AI, focusing on building an AI-powered dialogue-based tutoring system capable of providing learners with high-quality, interactive, and personalized education in STEM subjects.\n\nModerator: MBZUAI Professor, Timothy Baldwin",
