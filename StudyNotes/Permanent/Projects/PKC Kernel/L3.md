Aliases: L3, Layer 3

In both [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]], Layer 3 refers to the application layer of the respective blockchain networks. It is the layer where developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts that interact with the underlying blockchain infrastructure.

Bitcoin Layer 3:
In [[Bitcoin]], Layer 3 primarily consists of applications that use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or store of value. These applications include wallets, payment processors, exchanges, and other financial services built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. They utilize the core features provided by the Bitcoin protocol to enable secure and transparent transactions.

Ethereum Layer 3:
Ethereum's Layer 3 is more expansive compared to Bitcoin as it supports a programmable blockchain. Developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules written in Solidity (Ethereum's programming language). These dApps can range from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), gaming platforms, identity verification systems, supply chain management solutions, and more.

[[L2|Layer 2]] Scaling Solutions:
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum face scalability challenges due to their limited transaction processing capacities. To address this issue, various Layer 2 scaling solutions have been proposed. These solutions aim to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees by processing transactions off-chain while leveraging the security of the underlying blockchain.

Examples of [[L2|Layer 2]] solutions include Lightning Network for Bitcoin and various projects like Optimistic Rollups and Plasma for Ethereum. These solutions allow for faster and cheaper transactions by conducting most operations off-chain while periodically anchoring them back onto the main blockchain for security purposes.

Overall, Layer 3 in both Bitcoin and Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build innovative applications that leverage the decentralized nature of these blockchains while addressing specific use cases related to finance, governance, identity management, supply chains, and more.
