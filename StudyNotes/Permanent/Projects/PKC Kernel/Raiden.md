The Raiden Network is a second-layer scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to improve scalability and transaction speeds by enabling off-chain transactions. By creating a network of payment channels, users can conduct fast and low-cost transfers without the need for every transaction to be recorded on the Ethereum mainnet. The Raiden Network uses a system of balance updates and cryptographic guarantees to ensure secure and trustless transactions. It is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and facilitate micropayments, token swaps, and more on the Ethereum network.
