Aliases: NFT, Non-fungible tokens
---

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that use blockchain technology to establish ownership and provenance. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis because they have distinct characteristics and values.

NFTs can represent various forms of digital or physical assets, including artwork, music, videos, virtual real estate, collectibles, and more. Each NFT contains metadata that verifies its authenticity, ownership history, and other relevant details. This information is stored on a blockchain, making it transparent and tamper-proof.

One key feature of NFTs is their ability to provide artists and creators with a means to monetize their work directly. By tokenizing their creations as NFTs, artists can sell them on online marketplaces or auction platforms. The use of smart contracts enables creators to receive royalties automatically whenever their NFTs are resold in the secondary market.

NFTs have gained significant attention in recent years due to high-profile sales and endorsements by celebrities and influencers. Some notable examples include the sale of Beeple's artwork for $69 million and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's first tweet being sold as an NFT for $2.9 million.

However, NFTs have also faced criticism for their environmental impact due to the energy consumption required by blockchain networks like Ethereum. Additionally, concerns exist regarding copyright infringement issues and potential market speculation leading to price volatility.

Despite these challenges, NFTs continue to evolve as a prominent aspect of the digital economy. They offer new possibilities for creators to monetize their work while providing collectors with unique digital assets that can be easily authenticated and traded in a decentralized manner.
