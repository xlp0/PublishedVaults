#PKM2

[[PKM2|Personal Knowledge Management and Mining]] ([[PKM2]]) is an initiative that combines data mining, the power of blockchain technology, personalized knowledge management ([[PKM]]), and collaborative governance to create a data asset management solution based on the Science of Governance ([[SoG]]). It aims to harness the collective intelligence of participants through a computing power-intensive data mining community program that enhances knowledge exchange, innovation, inclusivity, and security.

[[PKM2]] differs from [[Personal Knowledge Management]]([[PKM]]) by involving a comprehensive workflow consisting of seven sequential steps:

1. Broadened Context, Objectives, and Goals for the PKM Community: This step involves utilizing data sources and [[OSS|Open Source Software]] to computationally extract hidden content knowledge in data sets that are embedded in the data content owned by individuals. It also utilizes the data sharing community to organize and share proven tools and methods to align goals and reduce frauds. It particularly relies on the public infrastructure of blockchain security enhancement.
    
2. Identify and Organize Relevant Localized Knowledge Sources: Participants are called upon to share their unique knowledge sources, and personalized knowledge mining techniques are employed to uncover hidden insights. Data asset categorization mechanisms are used to facilitate easy access and retrieval of information.
    
3. Utilize Up-to-date Tools and Techniques for Effective Knowledge Capture and Organization: Participants are provided with intuitive and [[SOTA]] tools, such as [[Obsidian|popular note taking front end]], and [[LLM|Large Language Model]] technologies. These new tools provide seamless knowledge capture and categorization. Collaborative spaces are established for participants to exchange insights and best practices.
    
4. Foster Active Engagement and Collaboration Among User Groups: Interactive platforms driven by personalized knowledge mining algorithms are developed to encourage diverse user groups to collaborate and engage actively. Features that suggest potential collaborators based on their expertise are implemented.
    
5. Establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([[DAO]]) with Inclusive Governance: Personalized knowledge mining is employed to ensure diverse representation in the DAO's decision-making processes. DAO governance tokens are introduced, granting participants a stake in decision-making.
    
6. Continuously Enhance Self-regulatory Governance Architecture: Personalized knowledge-mining insights are leveraged to evaluate and refine the DAO's governance processes regularly. A feedback loop mechanism is implemented to integrate personalized knowledge-mining analytics into the governance process. The mined content knowledge will be published in a [[PKC|Public Knowledge Container]] that stores the content knowledge of the [[Science of Governance]]([[SoG]]).
    
7. Facilitate Comprehensibility and Improvement through Collaborative Platforms: Information is presented using easily understandable formats, and collaborative platforms are created to incorporate version control, feedback mechanisms, and personalized knowledge-mining-driven insights.
    

Integration of [[Personal Knowledge management]] with Participant-Generated Content: The overall process is modeled as a continuous integration and continuous deployment ([[CICD]]) workflow that iteratively and concurrently deploys data content and provides feedback and incentives through smart contracts. A significant degree of automation and participant recognition is achieved by integrating [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]] with [[Langchain]], and [[Tool-LLM]]. 
## Mining Resource Scalbility
Mining data requires computing and storage resources. Resource constraint users may benefit from joining a community of data mining services to share a large collection of data content and computing resources. An existing project called: [[@borzunovPetalsCollaborativeInference2023|Petals.ML]] can be found on [[@GitHubBigscienceworkshopPetals|Petals Github page]].

# Conclusion

By incorporating reproducible tools like [[NixOS]] and [[Docker]], utilizing [[L2|Layer 2]] blockchain transaction services, smart contracts, and leveraging Network Attached Storage (NAS), [[PKM2]] can achieve improved efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and user experience. These enhancements ensure consistent deployment, secure transactions, reduced storage costs, and a seamless collaborative environment for participants.
