[[zkEVM]], also known as Zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a security implementation developed by [[Polygon Technology|Polygon]] (previously known as Matic Network) for Ethereum-based blockchains. It combines the power of zero-knowledge proofs with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing enhanced privacy, scalability, and security to decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.

The primary objective of zkEVM is to mitigate privacy concerns and improve scalability while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. It achieves this by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, which allow users to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information. This ensures that all computations remain confidential while still being verified by the network.

With zkEVM, Polygon aims to address the limitations and shortcomings of traditional Ethereum networks such as high transaction costs, slow confirmation times, and lack of privacy features. By implementing zkEVM on its sidechain infrastructure, Polygon offers users a more scalable and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

Some key features and benefits of zkEVM include:

1. Privacy: Users can execute transactions on Polygon's zkEVM sidechain while keeping their data private. Sensitive information like transaction values, inputs, and outputs remain confidential due to the cryptographic nature of zero-knowledge proofs.

2. Scalability: By offloading transactions to a layer 2 solution like Polygon's sidechain with zkEVM, scalability is significantly improved. The sidechain can process a higher number of transactions per second compared to the Ethereum mainnet.

3. Cost-effectiveness: With lower transaction fees on Polygon's sidechain compared to the Ethereum mainnet, developers can create dApps that are more affordable for end-users.

4. Security: Despite offering privacy features, zkEVM ensures that all transactions are auditable and secure by utilizing cryptographic proof systems. Validators can verify that computations are correct without needing access to any sensitive data.

Overall, zkEVM provides a powerful framework for implementing secure and scalable dApps on Ethereum-based blockchains. It allows developers to leverage the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum infrastructure. Polygon's integration of zkEVM contributes to their mission of creating a more efficient and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.
