[[L1|Layer 1]]([[L1]]) in [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]] refers to the base layer of their respective blockchain networks. It includes the underlying protocols and infrastructure on which the networks are built.

In Bitcoin, Layer 1 is also known as the Bitcoin protocol or Bitcoin Core. It defines the fundamental features of the blockchain, such as block creation, transaction validation, and consensus mechanisms (proof-of-work). Layer 1 handles basic functionalities like sending and receiving bitcoin transactions.

In Ethereum, Layer 1 is referred to as Ethereum Mainnet. It provides a decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and building decentralized applications (dApps). Layer 1 in Ethereum includes features like account management, gas fees for transactions, and consensus mechanisms (currently transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake through Ethereum 2.0).

Both Layer 1s serve as the foundation for their respective blockchain ecosystems, where higher-level layers or protocols can be built on top to enable additional functionalities and scalability.
