[Petals.ML](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals) is a project developed by [BigScience](https://huggingface.co/bigscience), a community project backed by startup Hugging Face with the goal of making text-generating AI widely available. Petals allows users to run [[Large Language Model|Large Language Model]] (LLMs) on their own computers, even if they don't have the powerful hardware that is typically required. This is done by dividing the LLM into smaller pieces and distributing them across a network of computers.

To use Petals, users first need to install the Petals client on their computer. The client can be found on the Petals website. Once the client is installed, users can connect to a Petals network and start running LLMs.

Petals is still under development, but it has the potential to make LLMs more accessible to a wider range of users. This could lead to new applications for LLMs, such as in education, healthcare, and research.

Here are some of the key features of Petals:

- It allows users to run LLMs on their own computers, even if they don't have the powerful hardware that is typically required.
- It is free to use.
- It is open source, so anyone can contribute to its development.
- It is still under development, but it has the potential to make LLMs more accessible to a wider range of users.

Here are some of the potential applications of Petals:

- Education: Petals could be used to develop educational applications that use LLMs to generate personalized learning materials.
- Healthcare: Petals could be used to develop healthcare applications that use LLMs to diagnose diseases or generate treatment plans.
- Research: Petals could be used to develop research applications that use LLMs to analyze large amounts of data or generate new ideas.

Petals is a promising project that has the potential to make LLMs more accessible to a wider range of users. It is still under development, but it is already being used by a growing number of people. I am excited to see how Petals will be used in the future.
