A microservice is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 

Microservices are designed to be modular and autonomous, allowing teams to work on different services simultaneously without affecting the others. They communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or message queues.

Key characteristics of microservices include:

1. Independence: Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, allowing for more flexibility and faster deployment.

2. Scalability: Microservices can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of a particular service as needed, ensuring high availability and performance.

3. Resilience: Since microservices are independent, failures in one service do not affect the entire system. It enables the system to continue functioning even if some services are down.

4. Technology diversity: Microservices allow developers to use different technologies or programming languages for each service based on their specific requirements.

5. Continuous delivery: Microservices are well-suited for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling frequent updates and faster time-to-market.

6. Fault isolation: If one microservice fails or experiences issues, it does not impact the entire system as other services remain unaffected.

However, microservices also come with challenges such as increased complexity in managing multiple services, inter-service communication overheads, and potential data consistency issues between services.

Overall, the main goal of adopting a microservices architecture is to improve agility, scalability, and maintainability of complex applications by breaking them down into smaller and more manageable services.
