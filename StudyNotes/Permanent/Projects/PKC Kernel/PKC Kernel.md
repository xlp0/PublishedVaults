#kernel
This is a piece of software that relies of the [[REPL]] mechanism to serve as a interface between physically located data and human activities.

## What is PKC Kernel
The Kernel of [[PKC]] is a data-centric program that registers events with [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] verification/validation for user [[Accountability|accountability]], and decentralized consensus time-stamps to guarantee event ordering([[Timeliness]]), and provide an expressive data structure to make data [[Observability|observable]]. The reason that this is called a Kernel has to do with the inspiration of [[John N. Shutt]]'s work on [$vau-Calculi](@shuttFexprsBasisLisp2010), an [[Ultimate Abstraction]], as a programming language kernel.

## The Content of the proposal
Rewrite the proposal to [[IEEE SA]] to position it as a [[L2|Layer 2]] blockchain infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of [[Bitcoin]] network's dominant security features, and the need to increase its programmability (Smart Contract) and off-chain transaction for speed. Reword the proposal as a new kind of [[IP License]] technical model, relating to [[Data Asset Management]], so that it will be a technical paper, a paper that has strong technical groundings while emphasizing its intellectual roots and social objective of establishing the [[Science of Governance]]([[Science of Governance|SoG]]) through technical means. It will mention the following three functional areas:

1. [[Knowledge Management]] and Dissemination
2. Technically Grounded [[Security]]/Anti-Corruption Features
3. Technical Standards and [[Reproducibility]]

## Workflow
Kindly provide a comprehensive overview consisting of seven sequential steps, accompanied by precise particulars at the secondary level, elucidating the proficient implementation of Personal Knowledge Management ([[PKM]]) strategies and Personal Knowledge Container ([[PKC]]) technologies. Furthermore, it is imperative for the project to place a high priority on the inclusion of diverse groups by actively engaging users in the effort to strengthen the security of Blockchain/Bitcoin. The primary aim of this endeavor is to establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The principal aim of the company is to continuously enhance its self-regulatory governance architecture. The adherence of this framework to a stated [[Constitution|constitution]] that is subject to modification as required is crucial. Furthermore, the firm aims to develop a collection of intelligent contracts that may be autonomously executed by machines, utilizing the security provided by blockchain technology. In addition, it is imperative to ensure the inclusion of all pertinent information in a format that is readily comprehensible to everyone, namely in the Wiki markdown style, with the aim of facilitating comprehension and improvement by Large Language Models (LLMs). Moreover, it is imperative for the system to systematically enhance textual data by employing GPT-like Large Language Models, as well as generating machine-readable and executable source code. By leveraging a uniform collection of data assets, this approach ensures the capability to execute and evaluate various functionalities, including smart contracts. The refinement process of these materials should incorporate the application of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) approaches that are consistent with the textual content derived from the PKM and the smart contracts mentioned earlier.

### Transformative Proposition: Personalized Knowledge Mining (PKM) as a Computing Power-Intensive Mining Community Program

Integration of [[PKM]] and [[Smart Contract|Smart Contracts]] with Participant-Generated Content

- The overall process should be modeled as a [[CICD]] workflow that iteratively and concurrently deploy data content and provide feedbacks and incentives through [[Smart Contract|Smart Contracts]]. This will be a direct implementation of the so-called [[Web3]] workflow. When participants will be making content changes on their own data repositories, and whenever their content gets pushed into a public repository, their contribution factors will be immediately registered by a [[Physical Meaning of Data|trust-worthy timestamp]]. Then, their contribution will be rewarded based on [[The Four Key Metrics|Four Key Metrics]] as defined by [[DORA]].
- Encourage participants to contribute expertise in the overall [[CICD]] workflow by giving tokens or certificates based on metrics dynamically updated in the system. A payment system or contribution registration system should be implemented in a [[L2|Layer 2]] blockchain, so that it can be ensured by [[Bitcoin]] or other reliable main-net's timestamp, and be [[trustworthiness]] in high frequency activities, such as retail transactions under the [[Physical Meaning of Data#10 Minute Window on Blockchain|10 minute window]].
- Incentive Models grounded on the [[The Four Key Metrics|Four Key Metrics]]: It is necessary to use [[PKC]] and other tools to consistently capture the contribution rates and content so that it will have a set of verified evidence to compute for the [[The Four Key Metrics|Four Key Metrics]]. It is also necessary to use these performance metrics to infer adequate incentive models for pricing the rewards and punishments for all participants and contributors. Only by having reliable data sources, the model can be considered [[sustainable]], and therefore align with the globally recognized [[SDGs]].
- Integrate personalized knowledge mining to analyze participant-generated content using [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]], [[Langchain]], and [[Tool-LLM]]. These [[Reproducible|reproducible]] automation tools make process debugging more transparent and therefore enhance the security and effectiveness of personalized data assets.
- Incentive Component: Provide bonuses to participants whose insights lead to improved smart contract designs. Utilize reproducible tools like [[NixOS]] and [[Docker]] for efficient deployment and management.
