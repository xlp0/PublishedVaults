Kernel of [[Attention]] ([[Kernel of Attention|KoA]]) is a computational framework to assess attention for a large collection of data content. The point is the utilize the computable meta-cognitive functions: $Q,K,V$ as defined in the paper:[[@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023|Attention Is All You Need]] as a basis to formulate a way to organize and refine data sets in a database.

The choice of the word "Kernel" for Kernel of Attention is to denote an Operating System Kernel. This should be a logical kernel designed in [[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s vision that helps one to thoroughly, and correctly prove the [[Relevance]], [[Similarity]], and [[Weight]] of certain pieces of data in the context of its users.

## Kernels as Conscious Agents
Every [[Kernel of Attention|KoA]] cab be considered as a [[conscious agent]]. This conceptual association grounds the work of [[Kernel of Attention|KoA]] as a set of labeled [[Simplex|Simplexes]] that can be composed into [[conscious agency]] that are [[Reproducible]] can be a highly concise way of defining these data artifacts. Specifically, [[PKC]] should take the software collection in [[UmbrelOS#Notable Apps in UmbrelOS App Store]] and repackage it into [[NixOS]]. 

## PKC Kernel
This is also proposed to become the kernel for [[PKC]]. See [[PKC Kernel]].

## Higher Granularity of Machine Learning
The functional goal is to use this platform to constantly guide its users with incremental data and knowledge accumulation in [[PKC]].  By applying machine learning computation to not only words and sentences, but also higher granularity of content, such as notes, and data files, it would be easier to identify data objects that are essentially larger bundles of data. This can also help better ground sentences and propositions created by [[Large Language Model]]s, avoiding the chances of hallucination by identifying them with large data objects, such as websites, files, and complete images.
