Please write me a plan with five main points to leverage Maker skills of Duwi Arsana and Dodok to better utilize local electronic and mechanical devices and standard communication networks for local hotel management in Bali, while capturing the content knowledge as YouTube Videos, and work with global electronic component suppliers and Maker Communities to create smart city standards with tutorial and Personal Knowledge management tools

1. Identify local electronic and mechanical devices: Duwi Arsana and Dodok should conduct thorough research to identify the electronic and mechanical devices commonly used in local hotel management in Bali. This includes understanding the specific needs and challenges faced by hotels in the region.

2. Develop YouTube video content: Utilize the Maker skills of Duwi Arsana and Dodok to create YouTube videos that demonstrate how to better utilize these local devices for hotel management purposes. The videos should provide step-by-step tutorials, troubleshooting tips, and innovative ways to optimize the use of these devices.

3. Collaborate with global electronic component suppliers: Reach out to established global electronic component suppliers who can provide high-quality components required for creating smart city standards. Establish partnerships or obtain sponsorships to ensure a steady supply of components for building prototypes and implementing smart solutions in local hotels.

4. Engage with Maker Communities: Connect with existing Maker Communities, both locally and globally, that focus on electronics, mechanical engineering, and smart city technologies. Collaborate with these communities through workshops, hackathons, or online forums to exchange knowledge, ideas, and best practices.

5. Develop personal knowledge management tools: Create personalized knowledge management tools that allow Duwi Arsana and Dodok to capture their expertise gained throughout this process. This could include documenting project details, lessons learned, troubleshooting guides, and other essential information. These tools will not only help them enhance their own skills but also serve as a resource for others interested in similar projects.

By following this plan, Duwi Arsana and Dodok can leverage their Maker skills to revolutionize local hotel management in Bali by utilizing existing electronic and mechanical devices more effectively. The YouTube videos will capture their content knowledge while promoting new techniques within the industry. Working with global suppliers ensures access to cutting-edge components while engaging with Maker Communities helps foster innovation through collaboration. Finally, developing personal knowledge management tools establishes a valuable resource for ongoing learning and sharing within the Maker community.

## Model City

The key idea of this project is to miniaturize a city, or a little resort, using automatic and electronic communication and control devices to reduce waste and increase residents' living experience. We want to have all these things physically located in a small film studio, so that we can continuously demonstrate the physical functionalities of interacting components. Please write a plan with the term ModelCity as its title, and spell out a few possible examples as the applications, such as automatic sprinkler, networked alarm system, automatic object detection, and solar power collection and monitoring systems.

Title: ModelCity Plan

Objective:
The objective of the ModelCity project is to create a miniaturized city or resort within a film studio, utilizing automatic and electronic communication and control devices to enhance residents' living experience while reducing waste. The project aims to demonstrate the functionalities of interacting components physically, showcasing various applications such as automatic sprinkler systems, networked alarm systems, automatic object detection, and solar power collection and monitoring systems.

Plan:

1. Conceptualization and Design:
   a. Create a detailed plan outlining the layout and structures of the miniaturized city or resort.
   b. Identify key areas for implementing various applications such as residential areas, parks, commercial zones, etc.
   c. Determine the scale and size of each component to ensure feasibility within the film studio.

2. Infrastructure Development:
   a. Construct physical structures within the film studio that represent buildings, roads, parks, and other urban elements.
   b. Install necessary wiring and connections to support electronic communication and control devices.
   c. Develop an integrated power supply system to ensure uninterrupted operation.

3. Automatic Sprinkler System:
   a. Implement an automatic sprinkler system throughout the miniaturized city for efficient water usage.
   b. Utilize moisture sensors or weather forecast data to automatically adjust watering schedules based on real-time conditions.
   c. Integrate remote control capabilities for manual adjustments or emergency situations.

4. Networked Alarm System:
   a. Install networked alarm systems in various buildings within the model city to enhance security measures.
   b. Implement motion sensors and surveillance cameras connected through a centralized monitoring system.
   c. Enable real-time alerts via SMS or email for unauthorized access or potential threats.

5. Automatic Object Detection:
   a. Integrate computer vision technology for automatic object detection in public spaces like streets or parks.
   b. Utilize cameras and image processing algorithms to identify objects such as litter, fallen branches, or misplaced items.
   c. Trigger automated actions like alerting cleaning staff or sending notifications to residents for lost items.

6. Solar Power Collection and Monitoring Systems:
   a. Install solar panels on rooftops and other suitable locations within the miniaturized city for renewable energy generation.
   b. Develop a monitoring system to track energy production, usage, and storage.
   c. Implement smart grids to distribute solar energy efficiently across the model city.

7. Demonstration and Showcase:
   a. Design interactive displays to demonstrate the functionalities of each application within

the system. This could include touchscreens, buttons, sliders, and other interactive elements that allow users to explore and interact with the applications.

b. Use clear and concise language to explain the purpose and features of each application. This could be done through written descriptions, voice-overs, or video tutorials.

c. Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use each application. This could be in the form of a user manual or an on-screen guide that walks users through the various functionalities.

d. Include visual cues and hints to help users navigate through the applications. This could be done through icons, tooltips, or highlighting important elements on the screen.

e. Incorporate user feedback and usability testing throughout the design process to ensure that the displays are intuitive and user-friendly.

f. Consider the target audience when designing the displays. Different age groups or skill levels may require different levels of guidance and interaction.

g. Make use of animations and visual effects to enhance the overall user experience. For example, when a user clicks on a button, it could animate or change color to provide feedback.

h. Test the displays on different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

i. Continuously update and improve the interactive displays based on user feedback and usage data.

Overall, the goal is to create interactive displays that effectively showcase each application's functionalities while being intuitive and easy for users to navigate.
