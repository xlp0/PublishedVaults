#XLP #SoG

Model City is a miniaturized physical model that demonstrates the functionality of interacting systems. The earliest implementation included the projects conducted as [[XLP]] learning activities in 2012. Other implementations include [[Duckie Town]] at MIT and ETH. Ideally, it should be deployed as the capstone project for school districts that implement [[GASing]] methods.

## Modularity and Composability
The main purpose of a [[Model City]] is to use a physical model of a city to demonstrate modularized functional components and physical contexts. Given the increasingly capable computing and communicating mobile devices, it would be most convenient and economical to use Android OS and even iOS systems as two interacting computing platforms. The Model City should also adopt some operating system kernel, ideally following the notion of [[Fab City OS]], where it could be a data-intensive [[OS|operating system]] that is capable of subsuming other interacting devices each running a localized operating system.
