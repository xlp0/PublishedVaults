- [x] Write down ideas about [[Simplex|Simplexes]]/[[Complex|Complexes]]
- [x] Call Beijing friends to make sure they are OK (after the Aug 5th Earth Quake)



As I watch the video on [[@profghristmathFTDAINTROTOPOLOGICAL2023|Foundations of Topological Data Analysis]]([[@profghristmathFTDAINTROTOPOLOGICAL2023|FTDA]]), by [[Vidit Nanda]], and [[Robert Ghrist]]. I realized that simplexes are the [[Universality|universal]] building blocks for 3-D geometry and higher dimensional data systems. It is particularly ideal to be used as a language to describe [[Origami]].
