```dataview
TABLE
FROM #DIARY
WHERE weight > 90
```

Simply add this code to any note in your Obsidian Vault, and it will display a table with all the notes tagged as #PERIDICALS. You can customize the code further to include additional fields or filter the results based on different criteria.

Make sure you have the Dataview plugin installed and enabled in your Obsidian settings for this to work.
