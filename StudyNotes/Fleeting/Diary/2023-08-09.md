What if all data presented on personal devices always have up-to-date [[Correctness]] indicators associated with them? Will this significantly improve the quality of personal judgments? This will be the research direction of [[PKC]].

# The Design Principle 
It should be able to considerably increase a person's and even a group of people's thinking and performance capacities by offering a flexible yet universally expressive language. In other words, creating effective languages in localized contexts is the most effective way to support the [[Correctness|correctness]] of actions through rigorous thinking. More crucially, a modern, iterative technique for enhancing language's expressiveness and effectiveness over time. Knowing that [[PKC]] is essentially a digital dictionary, with language understanding and networked computation execution capability, this means that we can create a dictionary and a set of languages in a [[PKC]] so that the language design and evolution process can be computationally tracked for personalized usage contexts. In other words, [[PKC]] provides a common data structure to support the comparison and evaluation of the qualities of [[Context-sensitive language|context-sensitive languages]], so that the selection of language design patterns would be done in an automated manner.
