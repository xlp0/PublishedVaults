- [x] Redo Diary for the missing content on August 2, 2023

This is the day that I encounter problems with Obsidian Git's Auto Backup problem. The root is that when using "Git rebase -i" the interactive interface requires users to pick the proper hash code for the snapshot. I was ignoring the instructions in the interactive interface, so that it keeps picking up the older version content. 

I also discovered that users could manually restore and unstage changes, but that is too much work, it can be done by simply doing the rebase and pick instruction, that would be much faster for the purpose that I wanted to accomplish.
