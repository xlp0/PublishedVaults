## Use Text Generator with ChatGPT


Please show me how to write a Hello World in Python. (Then type [[Command P]] then type "Text Generator: Generate Text" in the command panel , or just  _Command J_)

To write a Hello World program in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new Python file with a ".py" extension.

3. In the file, type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

4. Save the file with a meaningful name like "hello_world.py".

5. Open your command prompt or terminal.

6. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.

7. Type `python hello_world.py` and press Enter.

You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed in the terminal.

Note: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and properly configured in your environment variables for this to work correctly.

Now, let's proceed with generating text using [[Command P]] and typing "Text Generator: Generate Text" in the command panel.
