目前十分火爆的元宇宙作为新一代的互联网，呼唤一个人人都能随时随地在互联网上线创作任意形态与规模虚拟世界的3D引擎。Web3D在移动互联网上无需安装任何插件且跨平台运行，据有高易用性、便捷性、普适性与天然的去中心化特性，广为业界所接受，并逐渐成为元宇宙的天然选择。
当然元宇宙的场景规模趋于无穷大，且其上线人数也都趋于无穷多，这从服务器端到网络传输再到网页端呈现都对Web3D引擎形成了极具严峻的挑战（1. 场景规模实在太大；2. 网络传输加载实在太卡；3. 网页端渲染速度实在太慢而且渲染效果实在太差）。
本课题团队18年来一直以应用驱动的研究模式，围绕着Web3D这三大长期的瓶颈问题进行长期的深耕研究与技术攻坚，逐步提炼出来了从服务器至网络传输再到网页端渲染一整套的高效率、高品质、高精度、低成本、低能耗、低延迟的轻量级在线解决方案：（1）海量虚拟世界场景的轻量级细粒度化预处理；（2）支持多人在线共享虚拟世界的网络传输调度机制；（3）海量Web3D场景复杂光影的轻量级在线高品质渲染。
上述解决方案在多个大型的WebBIM与WebCIM等项目实战中得到了充分的验证。报告最后也会提供了一个大型在线数字孪生工厂在线WebTwin项目的网址链接让大家在线体验畅游200GB的大规模虚拟工厂。我们多年来所研究的轻量级Web3D关键技术为元宇宙奠定了扎实的研究基础与技术支撑平台，对下一步研发自主原创的元宇宙级Web3D引擎进行了展望。"

The currently booming metaverse, as the new generation of the internet, calls for a 3D engine that allows everyone to create virtual worlds of any form and scale online at any time and anywhere. Web3D, running on the mobile internet without the need for installing any plugins and being cross-platform, is highly user-friendly, convenient, ubiquitous, and naturally decentralized. It has been widely accepted by the industry and gradually becomes the natural choice for the metaverse.

However, the scale of the metaverse tends to be infinitely large, and the number of users going online also tends to be infinitely numerous. This poses significant challenges to Web3D engines in terms of server-side processing, network transmission, and web page rendering. These challenges include: (1) Dealing with the enormous scale of virtual world scenes; (2) Overcoming the issues of lag during network transmission; (3) Improving the web page rendering speed and enhancing the rendering quality.

For the past 18 years, our research team has been driven by application-oriented research, focusing on solving the three long-term bottlenecks of Web3D. Through continuous research and technical breakthroughs, we have developed a complete set of lightweight online solutions from server-side processing to network transmission and web page rendering. These solutions are characterized by high efficiency, high quality, high precision, low cost, low energy consumption, and low latency. The solutions include: (1) Lightweight and fine-grained preprocessing of massive virtual world scenes; (2) Network transmission scheduling mechanisms to support multiple users sharing virtual worlds online; (3) Lightweight online high-quality rendering of complex lighting and shadows in vast Web3D scenes.

These solutions have been thoroughly validated through practical implementation in various large-scale projects such as WebBIM and WebCIM. At the end of the report, we will also provide a link to a large-scale online digital twin factory project called WebTwin, where users can experience a massive 200GB virtual factory. Our research on lightweight Web3D key technologies over the years has laid a solid research foundation and technological support platform for the metaverse, and we are looking forward to the next step of developing an independent and original metaverse-level Web3D engine.

As the new generation of the internet, the already thriving metaverse begs for a 3D engine that allows anybody to construct virtual worlds of any form and scale online at any time and from any location. Web3D, which runs on mobile internet without the need for plugins and is cross-platform, is extremely user-friendly, convenient, omnipresent, and organically decentralized. It has gained widespread acceptance in the industry and is increasingly becoming the obvious choice for the metaverse.

The scale of the metaverse, on the other hand, tends to be indefinitely huge, as do the number of users who go online. Web3D engines face substantial hurdles in terms of server-side processing, network transfer, and web page rendering as a result of this. These challenges include: (1) dealing with the large scale of virtual world sceneries; (2) overcoming network lag concerns; and (3) improving web page rendering speed and rendering quality.

Our research team has been motivated by application-oriented research for the past 18 years, focusing on tackling the three long-term bottlenecks of Web3D. We have built a complete range of lightweight online solutions, from server-side processing to network transmission and web page rendering, through constant research and technological advances. High efficiency, high quality, high precision, low cost, low energy consumption, and low latency characterize these solutions. (1) Lightweight and fine-grained preprocessing of massive virtual world scenes; (2) Network transmission scheduling mechanisms to support multiple users sharing virtual worlds online; and (3) Lightweight online high-quality rendering of complex lighting and shadows in vast Web3D scenes are among the solutions.

These technologies have been rigorously tested through practical implementation in a variety of large-scale projects, including WebBIM and WebCIM. We will also provide a link at the end of the report to a large-scale online digital twin factory project called WebTwin, where viewers can explore a vast 200GB virtual factory. Over the years, our research on lightweight Web3D essential technologies has created a solid research foundation and technological support platform for the metaverse, and we are excited to take the next step in establishing an independent and unique metaverse-level Web3D engine.
