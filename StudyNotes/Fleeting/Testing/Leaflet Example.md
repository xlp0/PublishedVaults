Yes, you can use Obsidian syntax to create a Leaflet map of Bali. Here's an example of how you can do it:

1. Create a new note in Obsidian and give it a meaningful name, such as "Bali Map".

2. Use the following code block to define the HTML structure for your map:

```html
<div id="map" style="height: 500px;"></div>
```

3. Add a script block to load the Leaflet library and initialize the map:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
<script>
    var map = L.map('map').setView([-8.3405, 115.0920], 10);
    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo(map);
</script>
```

In this example, we're using OpenStreetMap as the tile layer provider and centering the map around Bali's coordinates (`[-8.3405, 115.0920]`) with an initial zoom level of `10`.

4. Customize your map by adding markers, polygons, or other layers using additional JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag.

For example, to add a marker at Bali's capital Denpasar, you can use the following code:

```html
<script>
    var marker = L.marker([-8.6526, 115.2192]).addTo(map);
    marker.bindPopup("<b>Denpasar</b><br>Capital of Bali").openPopup();
</script>
```

This will add a marker with a popup displaying the name and description of Denpasar.

5. Save the note and preview it in Obsidian. You should see a Leaflet map of Bali with any additional layers or markers you've added.

Note: Make sure you have an active internet connection while previewing the note, as the Leaflet library and tile layer are loaded dynamically from external sources.
