How to use Latex

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$


To use LaTeX, follow these steps:

1. Install LaTeX: LaTeX is a typesetting system that requires an installation on your computer. You can download and install LaTeX distributions like TeX Live (for Windows, macOS, and Linux) or MiKTeX (Windows) from their respective websites.

2. Choose a LaTeX editor: There are several editors available for writing LaTeX documents. Some popular options include Texmaker, TeXstudio, Overleaf (an online editor), or even a simple text editor like Notepad++.

3. Start a new document: Open your chosen LaTeX editor and create a new document. Save it with the .tex extension.

4. Define the document class: At the beginning of your document, specify the class of the document using the \documentclass command. For example, if you want to write an article, use \documentclass{article}.

5. Begin the document: After defining the class, start writing your content within the \begin{document} and \end{document} tags.

6. Format your content: Use various LaTeX commands to format your text such as making it bold (\textbf{}), italic (\textit{}), or underlined (\underline{}). You can also change font sizes (\tiny,\small,\large) and styles (e.g., \textsf{} for sans-serif).

7. Add sections and subsections: Structure your document by adding sections and subsections using commands like \section{} and \subsection{}. You can also add a table of contents using \tableofcontents.

8. Include mathematical equations: LaTeX is widely used for mathematical typesetting. To include mathematical equations, use the math environment enclosed between dollar signs ($). For example, $E=mc^2$ will display as E=mcÂ² in your document.

9. Insert figures and tables: Use the \includegraphics command to insert figures into your document (.jpg, .png, or .pdf formats). For tables, use the tabular environment.

10. Compile your document: Save your changes and compile the document using your LaTeX editor. This process converts the .tex file into a PDF or DVI format, depending on your settings/preferences.

11. Review and refine: After compiling, review your document for any errors or formatting issues. Make necessary adjustments and recompile if needed.

12. Share or export: Once you are satisfied with the final output, you can share the PDF file or export it to other formats like Word (.doc
