It was originally developed for Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, but has since been adopted by many organizations and individuals for various purposes.\nOne of the key features of MediaWiki is its ability to organize and manage knowledge in a structured manner. It provides users with tools to create articles, categorize them, link related articles, and create a hierarchical structure of content. This makes it an ideal platform for personal knowledge management.\nBy using MediaWiki for personal knowledge management, individuals can create their own personal wiki or knowledge base. They can document their thoughts, ideas, research findings, notes from books or articles they have read, and any other information they find valuable. The software allows them to organize this information into categories or topics, making it easy to navigate and find relevant content.\nMediaWiki also supports collaborative editing, which means multiple users can contribute to the same wiki. This feature can be useful for teams or communities who want to collectively manage their knowledge base or collaborate on projects.\nAnother important aspect of MediaWiki is its search functionality. Users can search within the wiki to quickly find specific information they are looking for. The software also supports full-text indexing and searching capabilities, which makes it easier to locate relevant content within large wikis.\nFurthermore, MediaWiki allows users to customize the appearance and functionality of their wiki through extensions and skins. This means individuals can tailor their personal knowledge management system according to their needs and preferences.\nOverall, MediaWiki plays a crucial role in [[Personal Knowledge Management|personal knowledge management]] by providing a powerful tool for organizing, documenting, searching, and collaborating on information. Therefore, it is also adopted as the primary software tool for [[PKC]] at the earliest stage. Whether used as an individual's personal reference library or as a team's shared knowledge base, MediaWiki offers flexibility and scalability in managing personal knowledge effectively.\n---END #10---\n---BEGIN #11---\nHub > Theory > Map of Content > Map of Content:\nAliases: Map of Content, MOC\n#MOC #visualization #landscaping\nIn the context of [[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PKM), the term \"Map of Content\" refers to a visual representation or organization of the various types of information and knowledge that you have collected and curated as part of your personal knowledge system. It helps you navigate through your digital or analog knowledge repository more effectively and aids in discovering connections and relationships between different pieces of information.\nThe Map of Content serves as a visual overview of your knowledge landscape, allowing you to see the bigger picture of how different topics, concepts, and resources are interconnected. It provides a way to categorize and structure your knowledge, making it easier to locate specific information when you need it and enabling you to identify knowledge gaps or areas that require further exploration.\nHere are a few common components or elements that can be part of a Map of Content:\n1. Topics and Subtopics: The map typically includes a hierarchy of topics and subtopics that represent the main areas of knowledge you have accumulated. These can be broad categories or specific subjects that reflect your interests, expertise, or professional domains.\n2. Notes and Articles: Your Map of Content can feature links or references to individual notes, articles, blog posts, or other textual resources that you have collected. These resources might be stored in a digital format (e.g., documents, web pages) or physical form (e.g., notebooks, printed materials).\n3. Multimedia Content: In addition to text-based resources, your Map of Content can incorporate multimedia elements such as images, diagrams, videos, or audio files. These can supplement or enhance your understanding of certain topics and provide alternative ways of accessing information.\n4. Relationships and Connections: The map can visually represent connections and relationships between different pieces of information. For example, you might use arrows, lines, or other graphical elements to indicate how concepts are related, dependencies between topics, or cross-references between different notes or articles.\n5. Tags and Metadata: Tags or metadata can be associated with each item in the Map of Content to provide additional context or enable advanced search capabilities. Tags can represent keywords, categories, dates, or other relevant information that helps you filter and locate specific content more efficiently.\n6. Annotations and Summaries: You may choose to include brief annotations or summaries for each item in your Map of Content, providing a quick overview or key points to jog your memory or facilitate understanding.\nThe exact structure and visual representation of a [[Map of Content]] can vary depending on individual preferences and the tools or software used for personal knowledge management. It can be a mind map, a visual diagram, a digital folder structure, or any other format that suits your needs and allows you to navigate and explore your knowledge effectively.\n---END #11---\n---BEGIN #12---\nLiterature > PKM > Tools > Excalidraw > PKC to PKM.canvas:\n{\n\t\"nodes\":[\n\t\t{\"type\":\"group\",\"id\":\"374489790c069f6c\",\"x\":-1900,\"y\":-960,\"width\":1320,\"height\":640,\"label\":\"PKMC\"},\n\t\t{\"type\":\"file\",\"file\":\"Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/PKC.md\",\"id\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"x\":-1880,\"y\":-829,\"width\":331,\"height\":400},\n\t\t{\"type\":\"file\",\"file\":\"Literature/PKM/Personal Knowledge Management.md\",\"id\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"x\":-1120,\"y\":-960,\"width\":540,\"height\":580}\n\t],\n\t\"edges\":[\n\t\t{\"id\":\"26d9747980d5b514\",\"fromNode\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"fromSide\":\"right\",\"toNode\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"toSide\":\"left\"},\n\t\t{\"id\":\"7c780caf61789fe2\",\"fromNode\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"fromSide\":\"top\",\"toNode\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"toSide\":\"top\"}\n\t]\n}\n---END #12---\n---BEGIN #13---\nPermanent > Projects > PKC Kernel > PKC Kernel:\n#kernel\nThis is a piece of software that relies of the [[REPL]] mechanism to serve as a interface between physically located data and human activities.\n---END #13---\n---BEGIN #14---\nHub > Theory > Sciences > Computer Science > Note-taking:\nAliases: Note-taking, note-taking\n#note_taking \n[[Note-taking]] is a fundamental practice in the field of [[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PKM). It involves the act of capturing and recording information, ideas, insights, and knowledge for future reference and use. Note-taking allows individuals to organize and retain information, make connections between different concepts, and facilitate learning and knowledge creation.\nIn the context of [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]], note-taking serves as a central component for managing one's personal knowledge. It helps individuals collect and store information from various sources such as books, articles, websites, lectures, conversations, or their own thoughts. These notes can then be categorized, tagged, and organized to create a personal knowledge base that is easily searchable and accessible.\nNote-taking in PKM can take different forms depending on individual preferences and needs. Some common methods include:\n1. Text-based notes: These are typically written in a structured format using bullet points or outlines. They focus on capturing key ideas, summaries, quotes, or important details from the source material.\n2. Mind maps: Mind maps visualize information in a hierarchical or interconnected manner by using nodes or branches to represent ideas or concepts. They are useful for representing relationships between different pieces of information.\n3. Visual notes: Visual notes involve using drawings, diagrams, symbols, or images to represent ideas or concepts. This method appeals to visual learners and can enhance understanding and retention.\n4. Audio recordings: Recording lectures or conversations can be an effective way to capture information verbatim. These recordings can later be transcribed or summarized into text-based notes for easier reference.\n5. Digital note-taking tools: Various digital tools are available that facilitate note-taking in PKM. These tools offer features like tagging, searching, linking between notes, synchronization across devices/platforms, integration with other applications (e.g., task management tools), and collaboration with others.\nThe goal of note-taking in PKM is not just to accumulate information but also to actively engage with it through processes like reviewing, reflecting, and connecting different ideas. By consistently practicing effective note-taking techniques, individuals can improve their knowledge retention, stimulate creative thinking, make better decisions, and ultimately enhance their overall personal knowledge management. In other words,[[Note]] is a type of [[Currency|currency]], or [[Token|token]] in the world of [[Personal Knowledge Management]].\n---END #14---\n---BEGIN #15---\nLiterature > PKM > Tools > Virtualization > Containerization Technology:\nContainerization technology refers to the practice of packaging software into self-contained units, known as containers. These containers include all the necessary dependencies and libraries needed for the software to run consistently across different computing environments.\n[[Docker]] is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. It provides an isolated environment for applications to run, ensuring consistency and portability.\nOther examples of containerization technologies include:\n1. Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n2. LXC/LXD: Linux Containers (LXC) is an operating system-level virtualization method that allows multiple Linux distributions to run on a single host.

It is designed to work with plain text files, making it flexible and compatible across various platforms and devices.\nOne of the key features of Obsidian is its bidirectional linking capability. It allows you to create connections between different notes by using double brackets around the note's title. These links help in establishing relationships between ideas, making it easier to navigate and explore your notes.\nThe software also supports the use of Markdown formatting, which enables you to add headings, lists, images, code blocks, and more within your notes. This makes it convenient for both writing and structuring your content.\nObsidian offers a graph visualization feature called \"Graph View.\" This feature displays an interconnected graph of all the linked notes, allowing you to visualize the relationships between them. It helps in understanding the connections and patterns within your knowledge base.\nAnother notable feature is its search functionality. You can search for keywords or phrases within your notes and quickly find relevant information. The search results are displayed in a sidebar, providing a preview of the matching content.\nAdditionally, Obsidian allows for customization through plugins and themes. You can extend its functionality by installing community-developed plugins or personalize its appearance with different themes.\nFurthermore, Obsidian provides local storage for your data by default, allowing you to have complete control over your notes without relying on cloud services. However, if desired, you can choose to sync your files across devices using third-party cloud providers like Dropbox or iCloud.\nOverall, Obsidian is well-suited for individuals who prefer a flexible note-taking system with powerful linking capabilities and customization options. Its focus on interconnectivity makes it an ideal tool for knowledge workers, researchers, writers, students, or anyone looking to organize their thoughts in a structured manner.\n...\n---END #16---",

It offers user-friendly knowledge presentation, extensible functionalities, and self-servicing data asset ownership in a single package. The goal of PKC is to make it easier for individuals to own their self-sovereign data assets by reducing the barriers to entry. A popular implementation is [[Network Attached Storage]] ([[Network Attached Storage|NAS]]), which basically has most of the functionality of [[PKC]].\nPKC was developed in context with [[XLP]] and the [[Science of Governance|SoG]]. A way to organize content knowledge can be considered to be an [[Intentional Workflow]], which can be implemented using [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]. It is also an embodiment of a [[Conscious Agency]]. Initially, it also must have many plug-ins for existing [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] tools to extract data for inputs and metrics of individual users and agencies.

This file-based abstraction is an important technical decision for managing data assets. To better organize data as a coherent asset, it is necessary to use a generic term, in this case, I will just call it: [[PKC]]. The generalized abstraction, say container, is a convenient and inclusive way to connect the notion of data asset management to knowledge management. [[PKC]] also fits better with the term: [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]], because they both directly denote the idea of Personal Knowledge Management and Containment, respectively. \nHaving chosen [[PKC]] as a broad class of technology. The integrative idea of data protection, storage, navigation, and refinement, became a natural extension. As new hardware instruments became available, the integration of cellphone-based [[Passkey|passkey]], high-performance [[Network Attached Storage|NAS]], user-friendly [[Note-taking|Note-taking]] tools, and Private GPT services became a product category that can be named: [[PKC]]. Moreover, a common trustworthy, and secure marketplace, say a blockchain-enabled [[DID]] infrastructure, must also be directly integrated with the [[Passkey|passkeys]]. The key point is that without simultaneously having all these above-mentioned services and capabilities to be made available at the same time, it would be difficult to grow the user base of [[PKC]] at scale.\n---END #13---\n---BEGIN #14---\nLiterature > PKM > Workflow > DevOps > Git > References:\n![[@d-i-ryGitGraphEasiest2021|Git Graph: the easiest way to start using git]]\n---END #14---\n---BEGIN #15---\nLiterature > PKM > Tools > Excalidraw > PKC to PKM.canvas:\n{\n\t\"nodes\":[\n\t\t{\"type\":\"group\",\"id\":\"374489790c069f6c\",\"x\":-1900,\"y\":-960,\"width\":1320,\"height\":640,\"label\":\"PKMC\"},\n\t\t{\"type\":\"file\",\"file\":\"Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/PKC.md\",\"id\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"x\":-1880,\"y\":-829,\"width\":331,\"height\":400},\n\t\t{\"type\":\"file\",\"file\":\"Literature/PKM/Personal Knowledge Management.md\",\"id\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"x\":-1120,\"y\":-960,\"width\":540,\"height\":580}\n\t],\n\t\"edges\":[\n\t\t{\"id\":\"26d9747980d5b514\",\"fromNode\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"fromSide\":\"right\",\"toNode\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"toSide\":\"left\"},\n\t\t{\"id\":\"7c780caf61789fe2\",\"fromNode\":\"8bae1eb68ebba31b\",\"fromSide\":\"top\",\"toNode\":\"aaa65420e0a5ab9c\",\"toSide\":\"top\"}\n\t]\n}\n---END #15---\n---BEGIN #16---\nLiterature > PKM > Workflow > XLP > XLP > The Three-Tiered Content Structure > Systems Thinking > Forrester's vision of Systems Thinking:\n![[Systems Thinking#Jay Forrester's version of Systems Thinking]]\n---END #16---\n---BEGIN #17---\nLiterature > PKM > Workflow > Zettlekasten > PKM:\n\n---END #17---\n---BEGIN #18---\nLiterature > PKM > Tools > Virtualization > PKC > Functional Requirements:\n[[PKC]] must fulfill the following requirements:\n1.

It encompasses various techniques and algorithms that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing objects or patterns, and adapting to new situations.\n[[Machine Learning]] ([[Machine Learning|ML]]) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML enables machines to automatically improve their performance over time by feeding them large amounts of training data and using statistical techniques to identify patterns or make predictions.\n[[Computer Science]]([[Computer Science|CS]]) is the broader field that encompasses AI and ML. It deals with the study of computers, computational systems, and their principles, including hardware, software, algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. AI and ML are specialized areas within computer science that utilize computational techniques to build intelligent systems capable of performing complex tasks.\nIn summary, [[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI|AI]] is a branch of [[Computer Science|computer science]] that aims to create intelligent machines capable of simulating human-like intelligence. Machine learning is a specific approach within AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. Both AI and ML are integral parts of computer science as they involve computational techniques for building intelligent systems.\n\n Recent Developments:\n[[Generative AI]], such as [[ChatGPT]], has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with technology and each other. By providing a more natural and conversational interface, it allows users to engage with AI systems in a way that feels more human-like.\nWith the delivery of Generative AI through platforms like ChatGPT, a popular movement can emerge where people adopt and incorporate this technology into their daily lives. This widespread adoption can lead to significant social changes and transformations in various aspects.\nOne area that can be greatly impacted is the way work is conducted. Generative AI can assist individuals in various tasks, ranging from creative writing and content creation to customer support and data analysis. This technology has the potential to automate repetitive or mundane tasks, freeing up humans to focus on more complex and meaningful work.\nMoreover, Generative AI can also change the way personal data content is managed and shared. As users engage with AI systems like ChatGPT, they may provide personal information or share their thoughts and ideas while interacting with the technology. It becomes crucial to ensure that this data is handled responsibly, protecting user privacy and preventing misuse. This can significantly improve the efficiency and socialization of [[Personal Knowledge Management]] workflows.\nTo manage personal data content effectively, new approaches may emerge. Privacy regulations might be updated or created to address the specific challenges posed by Generative AI. Users may have more control over their data and have mechanisms in place to decide how much information they want to share with [[Literature/PKM/Workflow/XLP/AI]] systems.\nAdditionally, new methods of secure data exchange could be developed. As individuals interact with Generative AI systems across different platforms or services, there may be a need for standardized protocols that facilitate safe data transfer while maintaining privacy.\nOverall, the popular movement driven by the delivery of Generative AI through platforms like ChatGPT has the potential to reshape various aspects of society. From transforming work dynamics to redefining personal data management practices, this technology opens up new possibilities for innovation and societal change.\n---END #9---\n---BEGIN #10---\nFleeting > Diary > 2023-08-01 > Integrating with Geographical and Diagrammatic technologies:\nI also downloaded [[QGIS]] yesterday, I also realized that [[mermaid.js]] is already mature enough to be deployed on [[Github]].
