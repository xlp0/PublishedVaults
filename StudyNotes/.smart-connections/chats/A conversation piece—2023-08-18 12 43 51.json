He was born on April 29, 1854, in Nancy, France, and passed away on July 17, 1912, in Paris.\nPoincaré made significant contributions to various areas of mathematics and physics during his career. He is best known for his work in the fields of topology, celestial mechanics, and the theory of dynamical systems.\nIn mathematics, Poincaré made groundbreaking contributions to the study of differential equations and their behavior. He introduced fundamental concepts such as the Poincaré recurrence theorem and the Poincaré map. His work on the three-body problem in celestial mechanics demonstrated that even seemingly simple systems could exhibit chaotic behavior.\nPoincaré's work in [[Topology|topology]] had a profound impact on the field. He introduced the concept of homology and laid the foundation for algebraic topology. His research on surfaces led to the formulation of what is now known as the Poincaré conjecture—a famous problem in mathematics that remained unsolved for over a century until it was finally proven by Grigori Perelman in 2003.\nApart from his mathematical achievements, Poincaré also made important contributions to theoretical physics. He played a crucial role in developing the theory of special relativity before Albert Einstein published his own groundbreaking work on the subject. Einstein himself acknowledged Poincaré's influence on his own thinking.\nPoincaré's influence extended beyond mathematics and physics. He also wrote extensively on the philosophy of science and made significant contributions to the understanding of scientific methodology and epistemology. His philosophical works explored questions related to determinism versus indeterminism, creativity in scientific discovery, and the nature of mathematical reasoning.\nOverall, Henry Poincaré was a highly influential figure who made profound contributions to mathematics, physics, and philosophy of science. His work continues to have a lasting impact on these fields, and he remains widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists of his time.\n---END #1---\n---BEGIN #2---\nLiterature > People > Bill Gates:\nAliases: Bill Gates， William Gates\n[[Bill Gates]] is an American business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] Corporation, one of the world's largest and most successful technology companies.\nIn 1975, Gates founded Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. They started by developing and selling software for personal computers, with their breakthrough product being the MS-DOS operating system. This operating system became a standard for IBM-compatible personal computers in the 1980s.\nUnder Gates' leadership as CEO, Microsoft became a dominant force in the software industry.

It played a significant role in popularizing personal computers and revolutionizing the way people work, communicate, and access information.\nBill Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in 2000 but remained active as a chairman and advisor until 2014 when he transitioned to a more philanthropic focus through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This foundation aims to improve healthcare and reduce poverty globally through various initiatives such as vaccinations, education programs, agricultural development, and more.\nOver time, Bill Gates has become one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to his success with Microsoft. However, he has also dedicated significant resources towards charitable causes through his foundation.\nToday, Microsoft continues to be a leading technology company under new leadership but still carries Bill Gate's influence through his legacy of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n---END #2---\n---BEGIN #3---\nLiterature > People > Alan Turing:\nAliases: Alan Turing, Turing\n#Turing\nAlan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, and logician who is widely considered one of the pioneers of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England.\nTuring's early work focused on mathematics and logic. In 1936, he published a groundbreaking paper called \"On Computable Numbers,\" which introduced the concept of a universal machine that could simulate any other machine by following a set of instructions. This theoretical device came to be known as the Turing machine and laid the foundation for modern computer science.\nDuring World War II, Turing played a critical role in breaking German codes as part of Britain's code-breaking team at Bletchley Park. He led the effort to design and build machines called \"bombes,\" which were used to decipher encrypted messages sent by the German Enigma machines. Turing's contributions to code-breaking significantly shortened the war and saved countless lives.\nAfter the war, Turing continued his work on computation and artificial intelligence. He developed a test known as the \"Turing Test,\" which examined a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being. This test remains influential in contemporary discussions about AI.\nUnfortunately, despite his immense contributions to science and technology, Turing faced discrimination due to his homosexuality. In 1952, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" under British laws criminalizing homosexual acts. As an alternative to imprisonment, he was subjected to hormonal treatment meant to reduce libido or sexual desires.\nTragically, Alan Turing died by suicide on June 7, 1954, at the age of 41. His untimely death cut short what could have been even more remarkable contributions to science and technology.\nIn recent years, there has been increased recognition of Turing's achievements and acknowledgment of the injustice he faced. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Turing, and in 2017, the Turing Law was enacted in the United Kingdom, granting posthumous pardons to men who were convicted of historical homosexual offenses.\nAlan Turing's work and legacy continue to be celebrated as he is recognized as one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. His contributions to mathematics, computing, and code-breaking have had a profound impact on modern society.\n---END #3---\n---BEGIN #4---\nLiterature > People > Joko Widodo:\nAliases: Jokowi, Joko\nJoko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, is an [[Indonesian]] politician who has been serving as the President of Indonesia since 2014. He was born on June 21, 1961, in Surakarta, Central Java. Before his presidency, Jokowi had a successful career in local politics.\nJokowi started his political journey as the mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012. During his time as mayor, he implemented various reforms and development projects that earned him widespread popularity. His success in Surakarta led him to become the governor of Jakarta in 2012.\nAs governor, Jokowi continued his focus on infrastructure development and public welfare programs.

His down-to-earth style and commitment to improving the lives of ordinary people helped him become a prominent figure in Indonesian politics.\nIn 2014, Jokowi ran for the presidential election as a candidate from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). He won the election with a promise to prioritize infrastructure development, reduce poverty, and combat corruption. Throughout his presidency, Jokowi has implemented various policies aimed at achieving these goals.\nUnder Jokowi's leadership, Indonesia has seen significant progress in infrastructure development with the construction of roads, ports, airports, and power plants across the country. He has also focused on improving access to education and healthcare services in remote areas.\nJokowi's administration has put efforts into economic reforms and attracting foreign investments to stimulate economic growth. However, challenges such as bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption still persist in Indonesia.\nWhile Jokowi has garnered praise for his dedication to improving people's lives and pushing for reforms, he has also faced criticism from some groups who believe that he hasn't done enough to address human rights issues or promote religious tolerance.\nOverall, Joko Widodo is a prominent political figure in Indonesia known for his focus on development, welfare programs, and commitment to improving the lives of ordinary Indonesians.\n---END #4---\n---BEGIN #5---\nLiterature > People > Ludwig Wittgenstein:\n#Wittgenstein\nLudwig Wittgenstein and Alan Turing were two influential figures in the fields of philosophy and mathematics, respectively. While they did not have a direct personal relationship, their work intersected in certain areas, and they each had a profound impact on the development of logic, language, and computation.\nLudwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. He is best known for his two major works: \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" (1921) and \"Philosophical Investigations\" (1953). In his early work, Wittgenstein aimed to provide a logical foundation for all language and thought. He argued that language mirrors the logical structure of reality and that philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings of language.\n[[Alan Turing]], on the other hand, was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He is considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing made significant contributions to various fields during his short life but is most famous for his concept of a universal computing machine – now known as the Turing machine – which laid the foundation for modern computers.\nAlthough Wittgenstein and Turing never collaborated directly or engaged in extensive correspondence, their ideas overlapped in some areas. Both were interested in formal systems, logic, and the limits of computation.\nIn fact, Wittgenstein's later work in \"Philosophical Investigations\" challenged aspects of his earlier views presented in the \"Tractatus.\" He explored how language functions within specific contexts rather than adhering to strict logical rules. This shift towards a more contextual understanding of meaning influenced later philosophers like John Searle and contributed to contemporary philosophy of language.\nTuring's work on computability also had implications for Wittgenstein's ideas about what can be expressed through formal systems. Turing's concept of an algorithmic process capable of solving any problem that can be described in a precise way challenged Wittgenstein's view that there are limits to what can be said and thought. Turing's theoretical model of computation helped establish the foundation for modern computer science, making him one of the most influential figures in the field.\nWhile their ideas intersected in some areas, Wittgenstein and Turing pursued different paths and had distinct contributions to their respective fields. Nevertheless, their work continues to shape our understanding of language, logic, and computation today.\n---END #5---\n---BEGIN #6---\nLiterature > People > Albert Einstein:\nAliases: Albert Einstein, Einstein, Albert Einstein's, Einstein's\n#relativity\nAlbert Einstein was a renowned physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists in history. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire (now Germany), and he passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.\nEinstein is best known for his [[Theory of Relativity|theory of relativity]], which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. In 1905, he published his groundbreaking paper on the special theory of relativity, introducing the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c). This equation showed that mass and energy are interchangeable, leading to the concept of mass-energy equivalence.\nIn 1915, Einstein formulated the general theory of relativity, providing a new understanding of gravity. He proposed that gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. The theory made several predictions, including the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of black holes. Subsequent experimental observations confirmed these predictions, solidifying Einstein's reputation as a groundbreaking physicist.\nIn addition to his work on relativity, Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory and the understanding of the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His work helped establish the concept of photons and contributed to the development of quantum mechanics.\nEinstein's scientific achievements were accompanied by his keen interest in philosophical and social issues. He was known for his pacifism, advocating for nuclear disarmament and international cooperation. Einstein was also involved in civil rights movements, speaking out against racism and oppression.\nEinstein's contributions to science and his public persona made him a cultural icon during his lifetime, and his name became synonymous with genius. His work continues to inspire scientists and shape our understanding of the universe. Einstein's scientific legacy, coupled with his humanitarian values and activism, has had a lasting impact on various fields of study and on society as a whole.\n---END #6---\n---BEGIN #7---\nLiterature > People > [@ellermanNewFoundationsInformation2021:\n\n---END #7---\n---BEGIN #8---\nLiterature > People > Ed Crawley:\nAliases: Ed Crawley, Edward Crawley, Edward Francis Crawley\nEdward Crawley is a renowned engineer and educator who has made significant contributions in the field of aerospace engineering.

A. R. Hoare\n#quicksort #hoare #CSP\nSir [Charles Antony Richard Hoare](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tony_Hoare), commonly known as Tony Hoare, is a British computer scientist who is renowned for his contributions to the field of computer science and software engineering. He is best known for inventing the Hoare triple, a formal method for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs.\nBorn on January 11, 1934, in Colombo, Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), Hoare pursued his education at the University of Oxford, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Classics and Philosophy in 1956. His interest in computers and programming emerged during his time at the university.\nHoare's groundbreaking contribution came in 1969 when he introduced the concept of the Hoare triple while working at the University of Oxford. The Hoare triple is a formal specification method that provides a framework for specifying and verifying the correctness of computer programs. It consists of three parts: a precondition, a program statement, and a postcondition. The precondition describes the state that must hold before the execution of the program, the program statement represents the code to be executed, and the postcondition defines the expected state after program execution. The Hoare triple asserts that if the precondition is true and the program terminates, then the postcondition will hold.\nThe introduction of the Hoare triple had a profound impact on the field of program correctness and verification. It provided a rigorous and systematic approach to reasoning about program behavior and allowed programmers to formally specify the desired properties of their code. Hoare's work on program verification contributed significantly to the development of formal methods and helped establish the foundation for modern software engineering practices.\nHoare has made numerous other notable contributions to [[Computer Science|computer science]]. He developed the QuickSort algorithm in 1960, which is still widely used today due to its efficiency. He also made significant contributions to programming language theory, concurrent programming, and the development of the programming language CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes).\nFor his groundbreaking work, Hoare has received numerous prestigious awards and honors. He was knighted in 2000 for his services to computer science. He has been awarded the Turing Award (1980), the Kyoto Prize (2000), and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal (2007), among other honors.\nThroughout his career, Tony Hoare has demonstrated a deep commitment to advancing the field of [[Computer Science|computer science]].

Here is a process diagram using Mermaid syntax that illustrates how PKC processes data:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Data Collection\"\n        DC1((Collect Data))\n        DC2((Validate Data))\n        DC3((Clean Data))\n    end\n    subgraph \"Data Storage\"\n        DS1((Store Data))\n        DS2((Encrypt Data))\n        DS3((Backup Data))\n    end\n    subgraph \"Data Retrieval\"\n        DR1((Retrieve Data))\n        DR2((Decrypt Data))\n    end\n    subgraph \"Data Management\"\n        DM1((Organize Data))\n        DM2((Index Data))\n        DM3((Version Control))\n        DM4((Apply Metadata))\n    end\n    subgraph \"Data Presentation\"\n        DP1((Visualize Data))\n        DP2((Generate Reports))\n        DP3((Share Data))\n    end\n    subgraph \"Data Transaction\"\n        DT1((Access Control))\n        DT2((Data Sharing))\n        DT3((Data Collaboration))\n    end\n\n    DC1 --> DC2\n    DC2 --> DC3\n    DC3 --> DS1\n    DS1 --> DS2\n    DS2 --> DS3\n    DS3 --> DR1\n    DR1 --> DR2\n    DR2 --> DM1\n    DM1 --> DM2\n    DM2 --> DM3\n    DM3 --> DM4\n    DM4 --> DP1\n    DP1 --> DP2\n    DP2 --> DP3\n    DP3 --> DT1\n    DT1 --> DT2\n    DT2 --> DT3\n```\n\nThis process diagram outlines the sequential steps involved in the data processing within PKC. It starts with data collection, followed by data validation and cleaning. The processed data is then stored, encrypted, and backed up. When needed, the data is retrieved, decrypted, and managed through organization, indexing, version control, and metadata application. The processed and managed data is presented through visualization, report generation, and data sharing. Finally, data transactions are facilitated through access control, data sharing, and collaboration.\n\n\nGiven the following text: \"Clave pública criptográfica (PKC) es un sistema de cifrado que utiliza un par de claves, una pública y una privada, para asegurar la comunicación segura y autenticación de datos. La clave pública se comparte con otros usuarios y se utiliza para cifrar los mensajes, mientras que la clave privada se mantiene en secreto y se utiliza para descifrar los mensajes cifrados. Este método de cifrado asimétrico es ampliamente utilizado en la seguridad de las comunicaciones en línea, como el intercambio de información confidencial y la autenticación de usuarios. La PKC se basa en la dificultad de resolver ciertos problemas matemáticos, como la factorización de números grandes, lo que la hace muy segura. Es un componente esencial en la seguridad de las transacciones en línea y en la protección de la privacidad de los usuarios\", please translate into Chinese.\n\n给定以下文本：“公钥密码体制（PKC）是一种使用一对密钥（公钥和私钥）来确保安全通信和数据认证的加密系统。公钥与其他用户共享，并用于加密消息，而私钥保持秘密，并用于解密加密消息。这种非对称加密方法广泛应用于在线通信的安全性，如机密信息交换和用户身份验证。PKC基于解决某些数学问题的困难程度，如大数因子分解，因此非常安全。它是在线交易安全和用户隐私保护的重要组成部分。” 请翻译成中文。\n## References\n\n[[個人知識容器]]\n\n[[@techcrunchAnytypeOpenEncrypted2020|Anytype as an Open and Encrypted OS]]\n\n[[@kuznetsovSecretDoubleentryBookkeeping2019a|The Secrets of DEB: Personification of Accounts]]---END NOTE---\n"
