In the world of [[blockchain]] and [[Web3]], "trustless" refers to a system or protocol that allows individuals or entities to interact with each other without having to rely on [[trust]]. It is based on the idea of using cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms to ensure the validity and integrity of transactions and information exchanged on a decentralized network.

Traditionally, in centralized systems, trust is placed in intermediaries such as banks, governments, or third-party service providers. However, in trustless systems like blockchain and Web3, trust is replaced by cryptographic proofs and algorithms that validate transactions and enforce rules without the need for a central authority.

By removing the need for trust, blockchain technology enables transparency, immutability, and security. Participants can independently verify transactions, validate data integrity, and ensure that no single entity has control over the system. [[Trustless|Trustlessness]] increases decentralization and reduces reliance on centralized authorities, thereby promoting a more democratic and resilient network.
