ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. It is a cryptographic algorithm used for creating digital signatures based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). ECDSA offers a secure way to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital messages or documents.

In ECDSA, a private key is used to generate a digital signature for a given message, while a corresponding public key is used to verify the signature. The security of ECDSA relies on the difficulty of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.

ECDSA has been widely adopted in various fields including secure communication protocols, digital certificates, and blockchain technology. It provides efficient and secure signature generation and verification with smaller key sizes compared to other traditional cryptographic algorithms like RSA.
