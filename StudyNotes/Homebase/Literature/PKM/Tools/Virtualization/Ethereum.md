Tell me about Ethereum

[[Ethereum]] is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and [[Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/dApp|decentralized applications]] ([[Literature/PKM/Tools/Virtualization/dApp|dApps]]). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer, in late 2013 and launched in July 2015.

Unlike [[Bitcoin]], which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum aims to provide a platform for developers to build and deploy their own decentralized applications on top of its blockchain. It features its own native currency called [[Ether]] ([[Ether|ETH]]), which is used to facilitate transactions and incentivize network participants.

One of Ethereum's key innovations is the concept of smart contracts. These are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions written directly into lines of code. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries in transactions, enabling direct peer-to-peer interactions with enhanced security.

Ethereum introduced its own programming language called Solidity, which allows developers to write smart contracts and dApps on the platform. This has led to a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications being built on Ethereum, ranging from financial services and gaming to supply chain management and identity verification systems.

Ethereum employs a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) called Ethereum 2.0 (or ETH2). This upgrade aims to improve scalability, energy efficiency, and security by transitioning from the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. The migration from PoW to PoS will occur in multiple phases over several years.

Additionally, Ethereum has its own decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem that allows users to access various financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges, and more directly from their crypto wallets. This has been a major driving force behind the recent growth in popularity and adoption of Ethereum.

# What are the main Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum?

The main [[L2|Layer 2]] solutions for Ethereum are:

1. Plasma: Plasma is a scaling solution that creates separate chains, called child chains or sidechains, which can process transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. These child chains are connected to the main chain through a parent-child relationship, allowing for increased scalability and faster transaction processing.

2. State Channels: State channels are off-chain solutions where participants can transact with each other without involving the main Ethereum blockchain. By conducting multiple transactions off-chain and only settling the final state on-chain, state channels enable faster and cheaper transactions.

3. Sidechains: Sidechains are independent blockchains that are connected to the main Ethereum blockchain through two-way pegs. They operate independently but can transfer assets between the sidechain and the main chain, providing scalability while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum's ecosystem.

4. Optimistic Rollups: Optimistic Rollups utilize fraud proofs to enable more efficient and scalable transaction processing on Ethereum. They allow for bundling multiple transactions together off-chain and then submitting a summary of these transactions to the main chain, reducing congestion and increasing throughput.

5. Zero-knowledge Rollups: Zero-knowledge Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof, which is then submitted to the main Ethereum chain. This approach allows for significant scalability improvements by reducing on-chain data storage requirements while preserving privacy.

These Layer 2 solutions aim to address Ethereum's scalability limitations by moving some transaction processing off-chain or by optimizing on-chain operations, enabling higher throughput and lower fees while leveraging the security of the Ethereum network.

# Conclusion

Overall, Ethereum has become one of the most influential blockchain platforms due to its ability to support smart contracts and enable the development of decentralized applications with real-world utility across various industries.
