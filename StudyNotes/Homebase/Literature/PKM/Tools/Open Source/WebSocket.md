WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It enables real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server, allowing them to send messages to each other without the need for continuous polling or frequent [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests.

WebSocket allows for persistent connections, meaning the connection between the client and server remains open as long as needed, reducing overhead and latency compared to traditional HTTP-based approaches. This makes it ideal for applications that require real-time updates or interactive features.

Unlike HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSocket allows both the client and server to initiate communication. It supports bi-directional data transfer, enabling instant transmission of messages or data updates between the two endpoints.

WebSocket is widely used in web applications for various purposes such as real-time chat applications, collaborative editing tools, online gaming platforms, stock market tickers, and live streaming services. It offers an efficient and reliable way to establish a continuous connection between clients and servers for seamless data exchange.
