What is GNU in Free Software Foundation terms?

In [[FSF|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) terms, GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix." It is a recursive acronym that represents an operating system and a collection of software developed by the FSF. The GNU Project was launched in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]] with the goal of creating a free and open-source alternative to proprietary operating systems like Unix. The GNU Project's software forms the basis of many popular free and open-source operating systems, such as GNU/Linux distributions.
