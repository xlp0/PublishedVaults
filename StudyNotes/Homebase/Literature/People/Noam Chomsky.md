Noam Chomsky, is a prominent American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, and social critic. Born on December 7, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Chomsky is widely regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals of the 20th century.

Chomsky's work in linguistics revolutionized the field and laid the foundation for modern linguistics. He proposed the theory of transformational-generative grammar, which suggests that language has a deep structure that can be transformed into different surface structures. His ideas challenged behaviorist theories prevalent at the time and emphasized the innate human capacity for language acquisition.

Beyond linguistics, Chomsky has been an outspoken critic of various political and social issues. He is known for his strong opposition to U.S. foreign policy, imperialism, capitalism, and media manipulation. He has written extensively on topics such as propaganda, media control, government surveillance, corporate power, and human rights violations.

Chomsky's political views are often associated with anarchism or libertarian socialism. He advocates for a society based on principles of liberty and justice where power is decentralized and individuals have control over decisions affecting their lives.

Throughout his career spanning over six decades, Chomsky has authored numerous books and articles that have been widely influential in both academic and activist circles. Some of his notable works include "Syntactic Structures," "Manufacturing Consent," "Hegemony or Survival," "Understanding Power," and "Media Control."

Chomsky continues to be an active public intellectual and frequently speaks at conferences, universities, and political events around the world. Despite his controversial views and criticisms of established systems of power, he has gained a large following due to his compelling arguments backed by extensive research in various fields.
