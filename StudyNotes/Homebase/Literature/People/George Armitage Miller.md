George Armitage Miller (February 3, 1920 â€“ July 22, 2012) was an influential American psychologist known for his significant contributions to the field of cognitive psychology. He made substantial advancements in the understanding of human memory, language processing, and cognitive capacities.

Miller was born in Charleston, West Virginia, and grew up in rural Pennsylvania. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Alabama and later pursued his Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard University, where he studied under prominent psychologists such as B.F. Skinner.

One of Miller's most famous works is the 1956 paper titled "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.]]" In this paper, Miller explored the limitations of human short-term memory and highlighted the concept of chunking, where information is organized into meaningful units or chunks to improve memory capacity.

Miller also played a significant role in the development of psycholinguistics, the study of language processing. His research on language and communication focused on topics such as syntax, grammar, and the cognitive processes involved in understanding and producing language. He also led a team to create [[WordNet]].

In addition to his theoretical contributions, Miller was an influential figure in the field of cognitive psychology as an advocate for interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of rigorous scientific methods. He co-founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University and served as its director from 1960 to 1985. The center became a hub for research and intellectual exchange, fostering advancements in cognitive psychology and related disciplines.

Throughout his career, Miller received numerous accolades for his contributions to psychology. He was elected as the president of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1969 and received the APA's Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1991. Miller was also awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honor in the United States, in 1991.

George A. Miller's work has had a lasting impact on the field of psychology, particularly in the areas of memory, language, and cognitive processes. His emphasis on rigorous scientific inquiry and interdisciplinary collaboration continues to shape research in cognitive psychology and related fields.
