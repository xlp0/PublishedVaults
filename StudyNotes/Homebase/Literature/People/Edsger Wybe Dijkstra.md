> Edsger Wybe Dijkstra ( DYKE-strə; Dutch: [ˈɛtsxər ˈʋibə ˈdɛikstra] ; 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, and science essayist.Born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Dijkstra studied mathematics and physics and then theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. Adriaan van Wijngaarden offered him a job as the first computer programmer in the Netherlands at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, where he worked from 1952 until 1962. He formulated and solved the shortest path problem in 1956, and in 1960 developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 in conjunction with colleague Jaap Zonneveld. In 1962 he moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven. In the late 1960s he built the THE multiprogramming system, which influenced the designs of subsequent systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory. Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation as its sole research fellow in August 1973. The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the "EWD" series, most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.

> Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, working in Austin, Texas until his retirement in November 1999. He and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in Nuenen, where he died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.He received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing structured programming languages. Shortly before his death, he received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year, in his honor.

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, commonly known as Dijkstra, was a renowned Dutch computer scientist and mathematician. He was born on May 11, 1930, in Rotterdam, Netherlands and passed away on August 6, 2002. Dijkstra made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of algorithms and programming.

Dijkstra obtained his doctorate in mathematics from the University of Leiden in 1959. He began his career as a programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam and later moved to Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys) where he worked as a research fellow.

One of Dijkstra's most notable achievements is the development of the shortest path algorithm known as "Dijkstra's algorithm." This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It has found extensive use in various applications such as routing protocols for network communication and navigation systems.

Dijkstra also made significant contributions to programming languages and software engineering. He was an advocate for structured programming, emphasizing clear code organization and avoiding the use of "GOTO" statements. His ideas greatly influenced the development of modern programming practices.

Additionally, Dijkstra played a fundamental role in developing operating systems concepts. He introduced various concepts like semaphores for process synchronization and resource allocation, which are now widely used in operating system design.

Throughout his career, Dijkstra received numerous awards and honors for his work. Notably, he was awarded the Turing Award in 1972 for his fundamental contributions to the field of programming languages and algorithms.

Dijkstra was known for his sharp wit and strong opinions on issues related to computing. His writings often exhibited a no-nonsense style that aimed at promoting simplicity and elegance in computer science.

Overall, Dikstra's work laid a solid foundation for many aspects of computer science that are still widely used today. His algorithms, ideas on structured programming, and contributions to operating systems have had a lasting impact on the field, making him one of the most influential figures in computer science.
