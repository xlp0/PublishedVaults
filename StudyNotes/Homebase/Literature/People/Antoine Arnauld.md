Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694) was a French theologian, philosopher, and mathematician. He was born into a renowned family of scholars and lawyers in Paris and became one of the leading figures of the Jansenist movement within the Catholic Church.

Arnauld's intellectual pursuits were diverse, but he is best known for his contributions to theology and philosophy. He played a significant role in the Jansenist controversy, which centered on issues of grace, predestination, and the nature of sin. Arnauld defended Jansenius's doctrine that emphasized human sinfulness and divine grace against the more lenient views of the Jesuits.

His theological work included writing numerous treatises, letters, and essays that engaged in sharp debates with his opponents. One of his most famous works is "Frequent Communion," where he argued for a more stringent approach to receiving the Eucharist.

In addition to theology, Arnauld also made important contributions to philosophy. He was a key figure in developing Cartesian philosophy alongside [[Ren√© Descartes]]. Arnauld collaborated with Descartes on "The Port-Royal Logic," which aimed to provide a systematic approach to reasoning and logic.

Arnauld's mathematical interests led him to correspond with prominent mathematicians of his time, such as [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. He made significant advances in infinitesimal calculus and probability theory, contributing to the development of these fields.

Despite his intellectual achievements, Arnauld faced opposition from both religious authorities and political powers due to his involvement with Jansenism. His writings were condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653, leading him to go into hiding for several years. However, he continued his intellectual pursuits while underground.

Arnauld's influence extended beyond his lifetime as his works continued to shape theological and philosophical discussions for years to come. His ideas on grace had an enduring impact on the Catholic Church, and his contributions to logic and mathematics also left a lasting legacy.

Overall, Antoine Arnauld was a prominent figure in 17th-century France who made significant contributions to theology, philosophy, and mathematics. His involvement in the Jansenist movement and collaboration with Descartes solidified his place in intellectual history.
