Congyue Deng is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University. He is the inventor of [[Vector Neurons]], a new neural network architecture that is equivariant to rotation.

Deng received his B.S. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2020. He is interested in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics.

Vector Neurons are a new neural network architecture that is equivariant to rotation. This means that they can learn to perform tasks that are invariant to rotation, such as object recognition and pose estimation.

Vector Neurons are based on a new type of neuron called a vector neuron. Vector neurons are similar to traditional neurons, but they have an additional dimension that represents the rotation of the input.

This additional dimension allows vector neurons to learn to perform tasks that are invariant to rotation. For example, a vector neuron could learn to recognize an object regardless of its orientation.

Vector Neurons are a promising new neural network architecture that has the potential to improve the performance of machine learning models on a variety of tasks.

Here are some of Congyue Deng's notable works:

- **Vector Neurons: A General Framework for SO(3)-Equivariant Networks** (2021): This [[@congyuedengVectorNeuronsGeneral2021|paper]] introduces Vector Neurons and presents a theoretical analysis of their properties.
- **NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis with Language-Guided Diffusion** (2023): This paper presents NeRDi, a neural network architecture for single-view NeRF synthesis that is guided by natural language descriptions.
- **Efficiently Learning to Compose Neural Networks** (2023): This paper presents a new method for efficiently learning to compose neural networks.

Deng's work on Vector Neurons has been well-received by the research community. His papers have been published in top academic conferences and journals, and they have been cited by other researchers.

Deng is a promising young researcher who is making significant contributions to the field of machine learning. His work on Vector Neurons has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about neural networks.
