Combinatorial physics is a field of study that combines principles from both physics and combinatorial mathematics to explore and understand physical systems. It involves the application of combinatorial methods and techniques to analyze and solve problems in physics.

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arranging, and organizing objects according to specific rules. It focuses on the properties and relationships of discrete structures, such as permutations, combinations, graphs, and networks. By integrating combinatorial ideas into physics, researchers aim to gain insights into complex physical phenomena and develop new mathematical tools for analyzing and predicting the behavior of physical systems.

In combinatorial physics, the emphasis is on understanding the relationships between different configurations and arrangements of particles or objects in a physical system. This can involve studying the possible states of a system, analyzing the properties of its phase space, examining the connectivity and topology of networks, or investigating the patterns and symmetries in a physical model.

Applications of combinatorial physics can be found in various areas of physics, including statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum information theory, and complex systems. For example, combinatorial methods are used to analyze the behavior of spin systems, study phase transitions, explore the properties of lattice models, investigate the entanglement structure of quantum states, and understand the dynamics of interacting particles.

Overall, combinatorial physics provides a framework for understanding the underlying structures and relationships in physical systems, enabling researchers to uncover new insights and develop efficient mathematical tools for solving complex physics problems.

According to a [[@matsciencechannelBirthNewDomain2015|video recording of Xavier Viennot]], one may reorganize physics in the term: Combinatorial Physics.

### Quoted from the video
The interaction between Combinatorics and Physics is not new: the classical combinatorial solution of the Ising model for ferromagnetism goes back to the 60's. In the last 30 years, there has been a renaissance of combinatorics, especially what is called enumerative, algebraic and bijective combinatorics. Powerful combinatorial tools have been discovered, in relation with other domains of pure mathematics, and such tools appear to be useful for theoretical physics. With some examples I will illustrate this fruitful interaction between combinatorics and physics, giving rise to a domain which can be called "Combinatorial Physics''. A new journal is born "Combinatorics, Physics and their Interactions'' in the prestigious series of the Annales of Poincare Institute in Paris. On the front page one can read "The unfolding of new ideas in physics is often tied to the development of new combinatorial methods, and conversely some problems in combinatorics have been successfully attacked using methods inspired by statistical physics or quantum field theory".
