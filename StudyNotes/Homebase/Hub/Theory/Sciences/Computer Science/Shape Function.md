In the [[Finite Element Method]] (FEM), shape functions play a crucial role in approximating the behavior of a physical system. These functions are used to represent the displacement or other related variables within each finite element in the discretized domain.

Shape functions are mathematical functions that define the local variation of the unknown field variable within an element. They are typically defined as polynomials and are chosen such that they satisfy certain properties, such as continuity and completeness, within each element.

The choice of shape functions depends on the type of finite element being used (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic) and the desired accuracy of the solution. Linear elements have simple shape functions defined by straight lines connecting nodal points, while higher-order elements involve more complex polynomial expressions.

The shape functions are defined in terms of local coordinates within an element. These coordinates typically range from -1 to 1 for one-dimensional problems and from 0 to 1 for two-dimensional problems. By evaluating the shape functions at these local coordinates, we can determine the values of the field variable at any point within an element.

During FEM analysis, shape functions are used to transform the governing equations from their original form (e.g., differential equations) into a system of algebraic equations. This is done by approximating the solution over each finite element using a weighted sum of shape function values multiplied by unknown coefficients called nodal values.

By using shape functions in this manner, FEM allows for a flexible representation of complex geometries and varying material properties within a computational domain. The accuracy and convergence properties of FEM solutions depend on proper selection and formulation of these shape functions.
