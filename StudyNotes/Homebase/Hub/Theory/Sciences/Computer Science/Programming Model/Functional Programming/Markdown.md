[[Markdown]] is a lightweight markup language that is commonly used for formatting text on the web. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of making it easy to write and read plain text that could be easily converted into [[HTML]]. Markdown is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to focus on the content rather than complex formatting codes.

Markup languages, on the other hand, are used to annotate text with specific instructions on how it should be displayed or processed. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the most well-known markup languages and is used for creating web pages. While Markdown is a simpler and more human-readable language, HTML provides more control over the structure and presentation of content.

Markdown can be converted into HTML, which means that it can be seamlessly integrated with websites and other applications that require HTML content. This conversion process allows users to write in Markdown format and then convert it into properly formatted HTML code.

Wiki platforms, such as MediaWiki (used by Wikipedia) and GitHub's Git repositories, often support Markdown as a way to format text within their systems. MediaWiki supports an extended version of Markdown called "MediaWiki Markdown" or "Wikicode," which combines elements of both Markdown and traditional wiki syntax. This allows users to easily create richly formatted articles on wikis using familiar Markdown conventions.

Git repositories also support a variant of Markdown called "Git Markdown." While similar to standard Markdown, Git Markdown includes additional features specific to Git's functionality. For example, Git Markdown supports embedding code snippets from repositories directly into documentation.

Both MediaWiki Markdown and [[Git]] Markdown are aimed at providing an easy-to-use syntax for formatting content within their respective systems while maintaining compatibility with standard Markdown.

In summary, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies text formatting for the web. It can be converted into HTML for integration with websites or used directly in wiki platforms like MediaWiki (MediaWiki Markdown) or Git repositories (Git Markdown). These variants of Markdown provide additional features and syntax tailored to the specific needs of their respective systems.

## Markdown and Zencode
It is conceivable to create a number of templates using [[Zencode]] syntax embedded in the Obsidian templates, so that we can incorporate natural language like statements to templates, while allowing [[Zenroom]] to perform some automated functions on notes written or generated in [[Obsidian]].
