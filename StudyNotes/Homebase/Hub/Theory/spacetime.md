In physics, the term "spacetime" refers to the combination of three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a four-dimensional framework. It is a fundamental concept in [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[Theory of Relativity#General Theory of Relativity|theory of General Relativity]], where spacetime is viewed as a unified entity in which events occur and all objects move.

In social contexts, the term "spacetime" can be used metaphorically to describe the way space and time are experienced and perceived by individuals or groups in relation to their social environment. It encompasses the idea that social interactions and relationships are influenced by both physical proximity and temporal factors. This concept is often used in sociology, anthropology, and urban studies to examine how social structures and practices are shaped by spatial and temporal dimensions. For example, studying how people's daily routines or commuting patterns affect their social interactions or examining how urban spaces influence social behaviors.
