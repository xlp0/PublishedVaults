In the context of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, the term "agency" refers to the capacity or ability of an [[Agent|agent]] to act and make decisions in pursuit of its goals or objectives. Agency is the characteristic that distinguishes an agent from a passive system or entity that simply reacts to its environment without any intentional or goal-directed behavior. See [[Donald Hoffman|Donald Hoffman's]] [[Conscious Agency]].

The concept of agency emphasizes the autonomy and self-directed nature of the agent, where it has the capability to perceive its environment, reason about its observations, and choose appropriate actions to achieve its objectives. Agency implies that the agent has some level of control and decision-making power to shape its own behavior based on its internal state and external stimuli.

In the field of artificial intelligence, designing systems with agency is an important aspect, as it enables the creation of intelligent and autonomous agents that can adapt, learn, and make decisions in complex and dynamic environments.

It's worth noting that while agency is often used in the context of AI and autonomous systems, the term can have broader meanings in different fields and contexts, such as in social sciences or philosophy, where it can refer to the capacity of individuals to act intentionally and exercise control over their actions and choices.
