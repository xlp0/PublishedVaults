The physical meaning of data refers to the interpretation and understanding of information that is represented in a physical or tangible form. It implies the significance, context, or implications of the data in relation to a specific domain or field.

For example, in scientific research, data can represent measurements, observations, or experimental results. The physical meaning of this data lies in its ability to provide evidence or support for a hypothesis, theory, or conclusion. It allows researchers to understand and explain phenomena, make predictions, and draw meaningful insights from the collected information.

In business and economics, data can represent financial transactions, market trends, customer behavior patterns, or other relevant metrics. The physical meaning of this data lies in its ability to inform decision-making processes, identify opportunities for growth or improvement, assess performance indicators, and drive strategic planning.

Ultimately, the physical meaning of data depends on its context and purpose. It provides a basis for analysis and reasoning to gain knowledge and make informed decisions within various fields of study or application.

# A more Theoretical Definition
[[Physical Meaning of Data]] is a [Platonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms) idea that is considered to be an earlier version of [physical Church–Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church–Turing_thesis#Variations). This idea also has triggered significant debates between [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Alan Turing]]. One way to start realizing the meaning of what data is physically could refer to the original words of [[Carver Mead]](Please watch the video on: [[@24InsightLogic|Logic in Physical Form]]). All these arguments indicates that data can be represented in different physical forms while [[M|representing the same thing]].
## Engineering Implication

The phrase, "Data has physical meaning" is particularly applicable to the architecture of computers or network of computers. The speed of how data can be transferred and the way how data are being represented determine the boundary of how data could affect the physical world. The intentional act to organize information processing tools, either by human organization or by machine architecture, is considered to be a way to assign physical meaning to data. For example, complex numbers are only required for [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum physics]]([[@24ComplexNumbers|Does Complex Number Exist?]]). That implies imaginary numbers are only required to represent the physical meaning of data in quantum physical world. For more discussions on this subject matter, please refer to [[Paul Dirac]] and [[John von Neumann]].

# Relevant to art
[[Leonard Shlain]] wrote books on this subject:[[@ArtPhysics|Art & Physics]], and [[ @shlainAlphabetGoddessConflict1999|The Alphabet versus the Goddess]].

# Relevant lectures
[[Leonard Susskind]] in his Oppenheimer Lecture<ref>{{:Video/THE 2022 OPPENHEIMER LECTURE: THE QUANTUM ORIGINS OF GRAVITY}}</ref> gives a good story about how to assign [[physical meaning of data]] that cut across [[Quantum Mechanics]] (microscopic phenomenon) and [[gravity]](macroscopic phenomenon).

## 10 Minute Window on Blockchain
The [[Correctness]] guarantee or rigorous ordering guarantee of the Bitcoin blockchain is limited by the 10-minute timeframe, resulting in a lowerbound resolution of 10 minutes. To clarify, the Bitcoin blockchain is a service that has the potential to facilitate the global data supply chain in providing a 10-minute data resolution for the Physical Meaning of Data.
# Historical Document
The first and foremost important document that stated this idea can be associated to [[Moore's Law]]<ref>{{:Paper/Cramming more components onto integrated circuits}}</ref>. This document is important because it links across socio-technical world, and explicitly stated that the physical size of data has economical and social implications (see [[Social Meaning of Data]]). The other document that also talked about the [[physical meaning of data]] is [[Paul Dirac]]'s book on [[@diracPrinciplesQuantumMechanics2013|The Principles of Quantum Mechanics]].
