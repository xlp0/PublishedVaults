Logic Kernel is a [[Zencode]]-enabled [[Logic Model]] interpretation engine that realizes [[Literate programming|Literate Programming]], and scale-free socially and physically meaningful data interpretation. It follows the software pattern: "[[REPL]]" and treats the computing result of a [[REPL]] process as a [[Universality|universal]] process component so that we have a consistent data structure and a singular algorithm to test the [[Correctness|correctness]] of all source code.

### Logic Kernel helps Operationalize Correctness
The purpose of creating the Logic Kernel is to define a logically sound mechanism to examine [[Correctness]] using available data and computational instruments. In other words, we will use [[Logic Kernel]], [[PKC]], and [[Obsidian]] as a combination of instruments to help users to attain [[Correctness]] with instrumental and theoretical support.

### Logic Kernel and Micro Kernel
See references on the implementation of [[REPL]] and Micro Kernels like [[Mach]].
