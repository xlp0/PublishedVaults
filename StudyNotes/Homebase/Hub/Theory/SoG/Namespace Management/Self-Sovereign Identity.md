[[Self-Sovereign Identity]] ([[Self-Sovereign Identity|SSI]]) is a concept that refers to individuals having complete control over their digital identity and personal data. It allows individuals to manage and share their personal information without the need for intermediaries or central authorities.

In traditional [[Identity|identity]] systems, individuals are often required to disclose sensitive personal information to different organizations or entities. This can lead to privacy concerns, data breaches, and lack of control over one's own identity. [[Self-Sovereign Identity|SSI]] aims to address these issues by giving individuals the ability to own and control their identity information.

SSI is based on decentralized technologies like [[Blockchain|blockchain]], which provide a secure and tamper-proof means of storing and managing identity data. With SSI, individuals can create a digital identity that is unique to them, consisting of various attributes such as name, age, address, qualifications, etc. These attributes are stored in a self-sovereign manner, meaning they are under the individual's full control.

One of the key principles of SSI is the idea of selective disclosure. Instead of sharing all personal information with every service provider or organization, individuals can choose what specific attributes they want to share in a given context. For example, when accessing a website that requires age verification, an individual can prove they are above a certain age without revealing their exact birthdate.

SSI also enables portability and [[Interoperable|interoperability]] across different platforms and services. Individuals can use their [[Self-Sovereign Identity|self-sovereign identities]] across various applications without having to create separate accounts or profiles for each service.

Furthermore, SSI promotes privacy by design principles. Identity data is encrypted and securely stored on the individual's device or chosen storage location rather than being held by centralized databases susceptible to hacking or misuse.

Overall, Self-Sovereign Identity offers individuals greater control over their personal data while enhancing privacy and security in digital interactions. It empowers users with the ability to manage their identities independently while ensuring trustworthiness and reducing reliance on third-party intermediaries.
