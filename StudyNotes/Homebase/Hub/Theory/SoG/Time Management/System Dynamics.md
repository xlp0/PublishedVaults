System Dynamics is part of control theory, and a term particularly used by Prof. [[Jay Forrester]] to describe how to diagnose system properties and design solutions based on various time-based variable interactions. It should be studied with [[Axiomatic Design]] and other related foundational and basic knowledge/skills, so that people or individuals can be much better informed of the consequences of their own actions and interactions.

I had a chance to ask Prof. Jay Forrester a few questions in class, when he simply asked me the question back:
> What are the sources that influenced the outcomes in your question?
- Jay Forrester
I realized at that time, the question I proposed to him must have been asked by many, and it also implies that he knew that most people just ignore the [[Hub/Theory/Category Theory/Meta knowledge]] part of the question. Meaning that most of the questions are so common, that must have a consistent pattern. In the case of System Dynamics, it is the time-based interactions that bound everything together. This idea can also be related to [[Judea Pearl]]'s causal diagram, which is a more probabilistic framework of causal structure.

While talking to Prof. Forrester I also realized that he is one of the few people who truly understand the meaning of sovereignty, or how to be [[autonomous]] in the process of decision-making. It was clear that all decisions are dependent on something else, therefore it would be most reasonable to study the causal dynamics of decisions or outcomes at once. At the end, either System Dynamics or Control Theory are about the essence of self-induced behavior, which is a significant portion of figuring out whether someone has free-will or not.
