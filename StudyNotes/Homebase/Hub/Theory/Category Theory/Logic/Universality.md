[[Universality]] is the essential property that defines a class or a category of objects of interests. The word "universal" in the context of mathematics, can also be said to be "essential". In mathematics, it simply means that any object or any system of objects that has certain "essential" properties, would be qualified to be a member in the said "[[Universality|universe of objects]]". Formalized definition of "[[Universality]]" is the [[Foundation]] of all intellectual and practical fields, that includes scientific, engineering, and even philosophical endeavors. Without a sound understanding and management of [[universality]], it would be impossible to discern the boundary or essence of the field of interest. Conversely, a field without a proper definition of [[Universality|universal properties]] should not be considered as a valid field of study. 

## Universality in Logic
Universality in the field of logic refers to the concept that logical principles and rules apply universally across different domains, systems, and situations. It asserts that logical reasoning is not limited to specific contexts but can be applied consistently and independently of any particular subject matter.

Universality in logic is closely associated with the notion of validity. Validity refers to the property of an argument where, if its premises are true, then its conclusion must also be true. The rules of logic are designed to ensure that valid arguments hold true universally.

One example of universality in logic is the law of non-contradiction. This principle states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense. It applies universally across all areas of knowledge and reasoning.

Another example is the principle of [[modus ponens]], which states that if a conditional statement "If A, then B" is true, and A is true, then B must also be true. This rule applies universally regardless of the content or context of the conditional statement.

Universality in logic allows for consistency and coherence in reasoning processes. It provides a foundation for deductive reasoning, where conclusions are drawn based on logical rules from given premises. By adhering to universal logical principles, we can achieve sound and valid arguments that are independent of specific circumstances or subject matters.

### Universality and the Void
A feature of logical universality is to imply that all valid constructs can be admitted as a truthful statement, meaning that it abstractly includes any possible explanations of certain phenomena. Therefore, all scientific endeavors must adopt this universal attitude to avoid prematurely rejecting certain hypotheses, before sufficient arguments are supplied. It opens up solution space to areas that may not have been conceived in the past.
#### Symmetries in terms of compliments
The above statement also indicates that to maximize the solution space, one must minimize the number of premature assumptions. This directly informs how to generate design documents and executable contracts. One way to systematically generate concrete solutions using abstract statements, one can set up logical templates that are minimalistic in terms of constraints, while allowing solution generators to explore and categorize the solution spaces in logically complementary segments. Similar ideas has been investigated, see [[@kooMetalanguageSystemsArchitecting2005|kooThesis 2005]]  and [[@kooAlgebraSystemsMetalanguage2009|kooAoS 2009]].

### Caveats in using Universality

However, it's important to note that universality in logic does not imply infallibility or absolute certainty. Logical principles are based on assumptions about truth values and relationships between statements or propositions. While they provide a robust framework for reasoning, their application can still be influenced by subjective interpretation or contextual factors.

Overall, universality in logic underscores the idea that logical principles apply universally and can be used as a reliable tool for rational thinking across various domains and disciplines.
