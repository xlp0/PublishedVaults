[[Logic]] is a branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning and inference. It encompasses various systems and approaches, each focusing on different aspects of logical reasoning.

## Logic and Composition
Logic can be considered as the study of reasoning and inference. It deals with the principles and rules that govern the process of drawing conclusions based on given information or premises. [[Compositionality]] is an important aspect of logic because it allows us to understand how complex propositions or statements are built from simpler components.

In logic, composition refers to the combination of logical expressions, such as propositions or predicates, to form more complex expressions. These combinations are achieved through logical operators such as conjunction (and), disjunction (or), implication (if-then), and negation (not).

By composing logical expressions, we can create compound statements that convey new meanings and relationships based on the meanings and relationships of their constituent parts. The rules of composition in logic define how these combinations are formed and how they relate to each other.

For example, consider the following propositions:

P: It is raining. Q: I will take an umbrella.

Using logical composition, we can form a compound proposition:

R: If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella.

Here, the logical operator "if-then" is used to combine the propositions P and Q to form the compound proposition R. The compositionality of logic allows us to understand the meaning of R based on the meanings of P and Q.

Moreover, logic provides rules for evaluating the truth or falsehood of compound propositions based on the truth values of their component propositions. These rules, known as truth-functional rules, define how the truth value of a complex expression is determined by the truth values of its constituent parts and the logical operators used.

Compositionality in logic is crucial because it allows us to analyze complex arguments and reason about their validity. By decomposing arguments into simpler propositions and applying logical composition, we can assess the logical coherence and validity of the argument's structure.
### Logic and Compositionality
Overall, [[Logic|logic]] and [[Compositionality|compositionality]] go hand in hand, as the principles of composition in logic enable us to understand how complex propositions are built from simpler ones and how they relate to each other in the process of reasoning and inference.

## Various area of Logic

[[Binary logic]], also known as Boolean logic, is based on the principles of true and false. It uses binary variables and operations such as conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), and negation (NOT) to evaluate logical statements.

[[Propositional logic]], also known as sentential logic, focuses on propositions or statements that can be either true or false. It employs symbols to represent statements and connectives to form compound statements. Propositional logic allows for the manipulation of these compound statements using rules of inference.

[[Many-valued logic]] extends beyond the binary true/false system by allowing for more than two truth values. It acknowledges that some statements may have degrees of truth or fall in between true and false. Many-valued logics include three-valued, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics, among others.

[[Categorical logic]] deals with categorical propositions that involve classes or categories. It uses categorical statements such as "All S are P" (universal affirmative), "No S are P" (universal negative), "Some S are P" (particular affirmative), and "Some S are not P" (particular negative). Categorical logic studies relationships between these propositions using conversion, obversion, and other inference rules.

Other branches of logic include modal logic, which examines modalities such as necessity and possibility; temporal logic, which focuses on time and temporal relationships; deontic logic, which deals with concepts of obligation and permission; and [[Intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic logic]], which challenges classical logical principles by emphasizing constructive reasoning.

In any case, one of the first thing to learn about logic is the notion of [[Universality]]. 

Overall, different branches of logic provide distinct frameworks for understanding and analyzing different aspects of logical reasoning in various contexts.
