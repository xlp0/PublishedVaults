#logic 
Modus ponens is a logical rule of inference that allows one to infer a consequent statement from a conditional statement and its antecedent. It is commonly represented as follows:

If P, then Q.
P.
Therefore, Q.

In other words, if a conditional statement "if P, then Q" is true and the antecedent P is also true, then the consequent Q must be true as well. Modus ponens is based on the idea that if the condition for an implication is satisfied, then the implication itself must be satisfied.
