In systems engineering, safety is defined as the state in which risks of harm or damage to individuals, property, or the environment are reduced to an acceptable level. It involves identifying potential hazards, assessing their likelihood and severity, and implementing measures to mitigate or eliminate the risks.

In [[Abstract Interpretation|abstract interpretation]], safety refers to the property of a program or system that guarantees the absence of certain types of errors or violations. It involves analyzing the behavior of a program using abstract mathematical models and techniques to prove that it adheres to certain safety properties. This can include ensuring that there are no buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or violations of security policies within the program.
