In [[Category theory|category theory]], the term "[[Arrow|arrow]]" refers to a fundamental concept used to describe relationships between objects in a category. Category theory provides a formal framework for studying and analyzing mathematical structures and their relationships. It focuses on identifying common patterns and structures that exist across different mathematical domains.

In category theory, an arrow is often represented as a directed line or an arrow between two objects within a category. It is also referred to as a morphism or a map. Arrows represent the relationships between objects and capture how one object can be transformed or mapped to another object within the given category. Arrows can be thought of as processes or transformations that preserve the structure or properties of the objects involved.

Arrows in category theory have certain properties and can be composed. The composition of two arrows represents the sequential application of the transformations they represent. If there is an arrow from object A to object B and another arrow from object B to object C, then their composition yields an arrow from A to C.

## Differences as arrows
In [[@allanglesHowSubtractionMakes2023|this video by All Angles]], the notion of [[Subtraction|subtraction]] is being denoted as an [[Arrow|arrow]]. This argument provides a powerful revelation, that all mathematical symbols must be adequately coherent with what it is trying to represent. The essence of [[Subtraction|subtraction]] is [[Symmetry|anti-symmetric]], therefore, it should be represented by an arrow that visually breaks the symmetry. Similarly, other operators, such as [[Division|quotient]] operator, should also be denoted using some kind of anti-symmetric shape. This idea was proposed extensively in [[Robert Coecke|Bob Coecke]]'s work.

## Causal relations as arrows
Now, moving on to causation in Judea Pearl's terms. [[Judea Pearl]] is a renowned computer scientist and philosopher who has made significant contributions to the field of causal reasoning. His work is based on the theory of causal inference, which aims to understand and analyze causal relationships between variables.

According to Pearl, causation can be represented using a graphical model called a causal diagram or a causal Bayesian network. In this framework, causation is depicted using directed arrows between variables, similar to arrows in category theory. These arrows indicate the causal relationships between variables, where an arrow from variable X to variable Y represents that X has a direct causal influence on Y.

Pearl's approach to causation emphasizes the distinction between causation and correlation. While correlation captures statistical relationships between variables, causation aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms or processes that give rise to those relationships. By representing causation through directed arrows, Pearl provides a visual and formal representation of how variables interact and influence each other.

Pearl's work also involves developing algorithms and mathematical tools to reason about causality. He introduced the concept of do-calculus, which provides a framework for answering causal queries and making causal inferences from observational and interventional data.

## Human Minds as a Directed Graph
In a PBS video, [[Kelsey Houston-Edwards]] stated that the neural network of a human mind is best modeled as a direct diagram.

In summary, in category theory, arrows represent relationships between objects in a category, while in Judea Pearl's work on causation, arrows represent causal relationships between variables in a causal diagram or a causal Bayesian network. Both concepts use arrows to capture the relationships and transformations between elements, albeit in different domains of study.
