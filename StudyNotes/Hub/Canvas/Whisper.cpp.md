[Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is an open source project that provides a high-performance implementation of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model in C/C++. It is a port of the original Whisper model, which is written in [[PyTorch]].

Whisper.cpp is designed to be efficient and easy to use. It can be used to transcribe audio files or live audio streams. It also supports a number of features, such as punctuation prediction and language identification.

The project is currently under development, but it has already been used in a number of projects, including the following:

- **Subler** is a tool for converting subtitle files between different formats. It uses Whisper.cpp to transcribe audio files into text.
- **Whisper-Transcriber** is a web application that uses Whisper.cpp to transcribe audio files.
- **Whisper-Kit** is a library that provides a high-level API for using Whisper.cpp.

Whisper.cpp is a valuable resource for developers who need to implement automatic speech recognition in their applications. It is a high-performance, easy-to-use, and well-documented project.

Here are some of the key features of Whisper.cpp:

- High performance: Whisper.cpp is designed to be efficient and can transcribe audio files in real time.
- Easy to use: Whisper.cpp is easy to use and provides a simple API for developers.
- Supports a number of features: Whisper.cpp supports a number of features, such as punctuation prediction and language identification.
- Open source: Whisper.cpp is an open source project, which means that it is free to use and modify.
## Instructions on how to use Whisper
