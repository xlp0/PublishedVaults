[[ggml|GGML]] stands for [[ggml|Generalized Graph Model Library]]. It is a C library that provides efficient implementations of common tensor operations, such as matrix multiplication, convolution, and pooling. GGML is used by the Whisper.cpp LLM to perform the underlying computations for the transformer model.

The Whisper.cpp LLM is a port of the OpenAI Whisper model to C/C++. The Whisper model is a large language model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text generation, translation, and question answering.

The GGML library is used by the Whisper.cpp LLM to improve its performance. By using GGML, the Whisper.cpp LLM can perform the underlying computations more efficiently, which allows it to run faster and on smaller devices.

Here are some of the benefits of using GGML in Whisper.cpp's LLM:

- Improved performance: GGML provides efficient implementations of common tensor operations, which can significantly improve the performance of the Whisper.cpp LLM.
- Smaller memory footprint: GGML uses less memory than other libraries, which can be important for devices with limited memory resources.
- Portability: GGML is a C library, which makes it portable to a variety of platforms.
- Ease of use: GGML is easy to use, which makes it a good choice for developers who are not familiar with tensor operations.

Overall, GGML is a powerful library that can be used to improve the performance and portability of the Whisper.cpp LLM.
