[[Polycomputing]], according to [[Michael Levin]], is a concept that aims to revolutionize the world of computing by utilizing multiple computers or computing devices to work together and solve complex problems. Levin is a software engineer and entrepreneur who has extensively researched and written about polycomputing.

In traditional computing, a single computer processes information and executes tasks. However, polycomputing proposes the idea of distributing computational power across multiple interconnected devices, such as laptops, smartphones, or even Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By harnessing the collective power of these devices, polycomputing aims to achieve higher computational capabilities than what a single computer can provide.

One of the key aspects of polycomputing is its focus on decentralization. Instead of relying on a centralized server or mainframe for processing tasks, polycomputing leverages distributed networks where each device contributes its computational power. This decentralized approach offers several advantages such as increased fault tolerance, scalability, and energy efficiency.

Levin envisions a future where polycomputing becomes the norm and enables various applications and services that are currently limited by the capabilities of individual computers. For example, complex simulations in scientific research or advanced artificial intelligence algorithms could be executed more efficiently by utilizing polycomputing.

Furthermore, Levin argues that polycomputing aligns with the principles of open-source collaboration and sharing resources among participants. He believes in creating an ecosystem where individuals can contribute their idle computational resources to support projects they care about while also benefiting from the collective power when needed.

Overall, Michael Levin's concept of polycomputing promotes a paradigm shift in computing towards decentralized networks that leverage multiple interconnected devices for enhanced computational capabilities. By harnessing the collective power of these devices through collaboration and resource-sharing, polycomputing aims to unlock new possibilities for solving complex problems in various domains.
