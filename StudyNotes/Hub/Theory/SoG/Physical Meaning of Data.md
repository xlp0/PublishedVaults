[[Physical Meaning of Data]] is a [[wikipedia:Platonism|Platonic]]/[[wikipedia:Theory of forms|Theory of forms]] idea that could be related to [[wikipedia:Church–Turing_thesis#Variations|physical Church–Turing thesis]]. This idea also has triggered significant debates between [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Alan Turing]]. The phrase, '''[[Physical Meaning of Data|Data has physical meaning]]''' is particularly applicable to the architecture of computers<ref>{{:Book/Computer Architecture}}</ref><ref>{{:Book/Computer Organization and Design}}</ref> or network of computers. The speed of how data can be transferred and the way how data are being represented determine the boundary of how data could affect the physical world. The intentional act to organize information processing tools, either by human organization or by machine architecture, is considered to be a way to [[assign physical meaning to data]]. For example, [[complex number]]s are only required for [[quantum physics]]<ref>{{:Video/Do Complex Numbers Exist?}}</ref>. That implies [[imaginary number]]s are only required to represent the physical meaning of data in [[quantum physics|quantum physical]] world. One should also listen to the original words of [[Carver Mead]]<ref>{{:Video/Insight 1:Logic in Physical Form}}</ref>.

# Relevant to art
[[Leonard Shlain]] wrote books on this subject:[[Book/Art & Physics|Art & Physics]], and [[ @shlainAlphabetGoddessConflict1999|The Alphabet versus the Goddess]].

# Relevant lectures
[[Leonard Susskind]] in his Oppenheimer Lecture<ref>{{:Video/THE 2022 OPPENHEIMER LECTURE: THE QUANTUM ORIGINS OF GRAVITY}}</ref> gives a good story about how to assign [[physical meaning of data]] that cut across [[Quantum Mechanics]] (microscopic phenomenon) and [[gravity]](macroscopic phenomenon).

## Relevance to Accounting
[[Measurement and objectivity in accounting]]

# Historical Document
The first and foremost important document that stated this idea can be associated to [[Moore's Law]]<ref>{{:Paper/Cramming more components onto integrated circuits}}</ref>. This document is important because it links across socio-technical world, and explicitly stated that the physical size of data has economical and social implications (see [[Social Meaning of Data]]). The other document that also talked about the [[physical meaning of data]] is [[Paul Dirac]]'s book on [[Book/The Principles of Quantum Mechanics|The Principles of Quantum Mechanics]]<ref>{{:Book/The Principles of Quantum Mechanics}}</ref>.

# Hardware Changes
This video<ref>{{:Video/How Vectorized built a Distributed Data Streaming Architecture for Modern Hardware with Seastar}}</ref> explains how to exploit the physical properties of data.
