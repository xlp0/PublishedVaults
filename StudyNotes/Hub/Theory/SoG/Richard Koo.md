Richard Koo([[辜朝明]]) is a renowned economist who currently works as the Chief Economist at the [[Nomura Research Institute]] (NRI) in Tokyo, Japan. He is known for his expertise in macroeconomics, financial markets, and balance sheet recessions.

Koo gained prominence for his analysis of Japan's "Lost Decade" in the 1990s when he correctly predicted that the country would experience a prolonged period of economic stagnation due to its balance sheet recession. He coined the term "[[Balance Sheet Recession|balance sheet recession]]," which refers to an economic downturn caused by a significant decline in asset prices and subsequent deleveraging by businesses and households.

His research on balance sheet recessions has been influential not only in Japan but also globally during times of economic crises. Koo argues that during these situations, conventional monetary policy measures are often ineffective as businesses and individuals focus on repairing their damaged balance sheets rather than investing or spending. He advocates for aggressive fiscal stimulus to counterbalance this private sector deleveraging.

As an economist at NRI, Koo provides analysis and insights into various economic issues affecting Japan and the global economy. His research covers topics such as monetary policy, fiscal policy, banking systems, and corporate finance. Koo frequently shares his views through publications, interviews, and speaking engagements.

Richard Koo's work has earned him international recognition, making him one of the most respected economists today. His observations on balance sheet recessions have proven valuable for understanding economic crises and formulating appropriate policies to mitigate their impact.
