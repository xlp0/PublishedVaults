## What does observability mean in sciences

In the context of sciences, observability refers to the ability to measure or perceive a phenomenon or system accurately and reliably. It involves the collection of empirical data through various methods, such as direct observation, experimentation, or measurement techniques. Observability is essential for scientific investigation as it allows researchers to gather evidence, analyze data, and draw meaningful conclusions about the nature and behavior of different phenomena or systems. It plays a crucial role in fields such as physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, and many others for advancing our understanding of the natural world.

## What does observability mean in DevOps

In [[DevOps]], observability refers to the ability to gain insights and understand the internal workings of a system by collecting and analyzing relevant data. It involves monitoring various aspects of a system, such as its performance, logs, metrics, and events, in order to identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and make informed decisions.

Observability focuses on collecting data from different sources within a system and providing visibility into its behavior and performance. This data is typically collected through various monitoring tools and techniques, such as log aggregation systems, distributed tracing frameworks, and real-time metrics collection.

By implementing observability practices in DevOps, teams can proactively monitor their systems' health, detect anomalies or errors early on, and quickly respond to incidents. It helps in improving system reliability, identifying bottlenecks or performance issues, optimizing resource utilization, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

## Observables and Hermitian Operators
In [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], observables([[quantumsenseChHowAre2023|1]]) are represented by Hermitian operators([[@quantumsenseChWhatAre2023c|2]]). A Hermitian operator is an operator that is equal to its own Hermitian conjugate, which is obtained by taking the transpose and complex conjugate of the operator. Mathematically, if we have an operator A, its Hermitian conjugate is denoted by A†.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator have some important properties. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real numbers. This is a consequence of the Hermitian property, which ensures that the eigenvalues are not complex. The eigenvectors associated with different eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are orthogonal to each other, meaning their inner product is zero.

When a physical quantity is measured in quantum mechanics, the outcome of the measurement corresponds to one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Hermitian operator. The probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the quantum state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

The expectation value of an observable represented by a Hermitian operator A can be calculated as the average value of the measurement outcomes over an ensemble of identically prepared systems. It is given by the expression:

⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩

where |ψ⟩ is the quantum state vector, and ⟨ψ| represents its conjugate transpose, known as the bra vector. The expectation value is a real number and represents the average value of the observable in the given quantum state.

In summary, observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to the possible measurement outcomes. The eigenvectors of Hermitian operators are orthogonal, and the expectation value of an observable can be calculated using the inner product of the quantum state with the corresponding operator.
