### Governance Frameworks in the field of data sovereignty

Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is collected or processed. As data becomes increasingly valuable and subject to privacy concerns, many governments and organizations have developed governance frameworks to address data sovereignty issues. These frameworks provide guidelines and principles for managing, protecting, and sharing data while respecting the legal requirements of different jurisdictions. Here are some examples of governance frameworks in the field of [[Data Sovereignty|data sovereignty]]:

1. European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is one of the most comprehensive data protection regulations worldwide. It applies to all EU member states and regulates how personal data should be handled, stored, processed, and transferred. GDPR ensures that individuals have control over their personal data and imposes strict penalties for non-compliance.

2. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): CCPA is a state-level privacy law in California, United States. It grants California residents rights over their personal information held by businesses operating in the state. CCPA requires businesses to disclose their data collection practices and allows individuals to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.

3. APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System: The CBPR system was developed by member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It provides a framework for businesses to protect personal information during cross-border transfers between participating countries. The CBPR system includes principles such as notice, choice, security, access, accountability, and enforcement.

4. Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA): PDPA is a comprehensive legislation in Singapore that governs the collection, use, disclosure, and care of personal data by organizations. It establishes a framework for managing personal data with consent requirements and provisions for individuals' rights regarding their personal information.

5. Global Privacy Assembly (formerly known as International Conference of Data Protection Authorities - ICDPPC): The Global Privacy Assembly is an international association composed of data protection authorities from different countries. It promotes global privacy and data protection standards through cooperation, knowledge sharing, and advocacy. Members of the Global Privacy Assembly collaborate on various topics related to data sovereignty, including cross-border data transfers and enforcement.

These governance frameworks serve as guidelines for organizations to ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations. By adhering to these frameworks, organizations can navigate the complex landscape of data sovereignty while maintaining the trust of individuals and complying with legal requirements.
