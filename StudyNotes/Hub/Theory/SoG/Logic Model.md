In the context of the United States' Managed Budget Office (MBO), a logic model refers to a systematic and visual representation of the relationship between program activities, outputs, outcomes, and goals. It is a planning and evaluation tool used to communicate how a specific program or initiative is expected to work and achieve its intended outcomes.

A logic model typically consists of the following components:

1. Inputs/Resources: These are the resources, such as funding, personnel, and equipment, that are dedicated to implementing the program.

2. Activities: The activities represent the specific actions and interventions that the program will undertake using the allocated resources. These activities are designed to produce the desired outputs.

3. Outputs: Outputs are the direct products or services that result from the program activities. They are typically measurable and tangible.

4. Outcomes: Outcomes are the changes or benefits that occur as a result of the program's outputs. They can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term and can be categorized into different levels, including individual, community, or societal outcomes.

5. Goals/Objectives: Goals are the overarching, broad statements of what the program aims to achieve in the long run. They are often aligned with the organization's mission and strategic objectives.

The logic model helps stakeholders, including policymakers, program managers, and evaluators, to understand the program's theory of change, identify potential areas for improvement, and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. By clearly mapping out the logic and assumptions behind a program, it becomes easier to measure progress, track outcomes, and make data-driven decisions.

Logic models are widely used in program planning, performance management, and evaluation in various government agencies, including the Managed Budget Office, to ensure that public funds are allocated to programs that deliver desired outcomes and results.
