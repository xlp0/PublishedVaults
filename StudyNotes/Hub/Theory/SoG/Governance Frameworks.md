What are the layers of Governance Frameworks in terms of Self-Sovereign Identities. In the book: [[@preukschatSelfsovereignIdentityDecentralized2021|Self-sovereign identity_2021]], it presented a diagram on P.108:

[[Self-Sovereign Identity|Self-sovereign identities]] ([[Self-Sovereign Identity|SSI]]) are a concept in which individuals have control and ownership over their personal identity data. Governance frameworks are necessary to ensure the effective and responsible implementation of [[Self-Sovereign Identity|SSI]]. These frameworks typically consist of multiple layers, including:

1. Legal and Regulatory Layer: This layer involves establishing laws, regulations, and policies that govern the usage, sharing, and protection of personal identity data within the SSI ecosystem. It ensures compliance with relevant privacy laws, data protection regulations, and other legal requirements.

2. Technical Layer: The technical layer focuses on the development and implementation of standards, protocols, and infrastructure necessary for the functioning of SSI. This includes defining interoperability standards for identity wallets, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials, and secure communication protocols.

3. Trust Framework Layer: Trust frameworks define the rules, processes, and requirements for establishing trust among participants in the SSI ecosystem. They outline criteria for verifying identities, issuing verifiable credentials, and resolving disputes or conflicts that may arise within the system.

4. Governance Entities Layer: This layer comprises various entities responsible for overseeing and managing the SSI ecosystem. These entities can include government agencies, industry consortia, non-profit organizations, or other governing bodies. Their role is to establish policies, set standards, enforce compliance with regulations, resolve disputes or conflicts between participants, and ensure accountability.

5. User Consent Layer: User consent is a critical aspect of self-sovereign identities. This layer focuses on empowering individuals to make informed choices about how their personal identity data is used and shared. It involves providing users with clear consent mechanisms to grant or revoke access to their data as per their preferences.

These layers work together to establish a robust governance framework for self-sovereign identities that balances individual control over personal data with privacy protection, security measures, legal compliance, technical interoperability standards, trust establishment among participants while upholding user consent rights.

# Other relevant frameworks
Self-sovereign identities (SSI) refer to the concept of individuals having control over their own personal data and digital identities. Governance frameworks play a crucial role in ensuring the secure and ethical implementation of SSI. Here are some notable governance frameworks in terms of self-sovereign identities:

1. Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF): DIF is a collaborative organization that focuses on developing open standards and governance models for decentralized identity technologies, including SSI. They work on creating interoperable protocols, specifications, and reference implementations to enable decentralized identity systems.

2. Sovrin Foundation: The Sovrin Foundation operates the Sovrin Network, a public utility for self-sovereign identity management based on blockchain technology. They have developed a governance framework that includes a governing board responsible for overseeing technical standards, policy development, and community participation.

3. W3C Verifiable Credentials: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed specifications for Verifiable Credentials, which are digital credentials issued by trusted parties and verifiable using cryptographic proofs. These specifications outline governance principles for decentralized identity systems based on verifiable credentials.

4. Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP): ToIP is an initiative focused on establishing a new trust infrastructure for the internet based on interoperable digital trust standards. Their governance model aims to create common frameworks, protocols, and certifications for SSI technologies to ensure trustworthiness across different systems.

5. European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (eSSIF): eSSIF is an initiative supported by the European Commission aimed at promoting the adoption of SSI across Europe. This framework focuses on addressing legal, technical, and organizational challenges related to SSI implementation while considering privacy protection and user control.

These governance frameworks provide guidelines, standards, and collaboration platforms for various stakeholders involved in self-sovereign identity initiatives, such as technology developers, identity issuers, verifiers, and users. They aim to ensure the security, privacy, interoperability, and user empowerment aspects of self-sovereign identities.
