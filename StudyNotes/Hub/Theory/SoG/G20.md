The [[G20]] ([[Group of Twenty]]) is an international forum that brings together the world's major economies, representing 85% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world's population. It serves as a platform for leaders to discuss global economic issues and promote international cooperation.

Each year, the G20 summit is hosted by one of its member countries. In 2022, it is expected that a member country will take on the responsibility of hosting the summit, but as of yet, the host country has not been officially announced.

The agenda for the G20 summit typically includes discussions on various economic and financial topics such as trade, investment, employment, and sustainable development. Additionally, leaders often address pressing global issues like climate change, digitalization, healthcare, and geopolitical challenges.

The G20 meetings involve not only heads of state or government but also representatives from international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank Group (WBG), and World Trade Organization (WTO). These meetings aim to foster dialogue and collaboration among nations to address common challenges and promote global economic stability.
