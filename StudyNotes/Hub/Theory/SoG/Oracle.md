In the field of cryptography and [[Blockchain]]-enabled smart contracts, an **oracle** is a data feed that brings data from off the blockchain (off-chain) data sources and puts it on the blockchain (on-chain) for smart contracts to use ². This is necessary because smart contracts running on Ethereum cannot access information stored outside the blockchain network. Oracles act as a “bridge” connecting smart contracts on blockchains to off-chain data providers.

For individual users, [[PKC]]s can provide authentication services or use the [[Soul Bound Token|SBT]] facility to provide the identities of sources of [[Oracle]] content.
