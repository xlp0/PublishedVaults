In [[Fab City OS]], the concept of [[DIDO|Data In/Data Out]] refers to the flow of information within the city's infrastructure and its impact on resource management and decision-making processes.

Data In refers to the collection of data from various sources within the city. This can include data from sensors, IoT devices, citizen input, social media, government databases, and other relevant sources. The goal is to gather as much real-time data as possible to understand the current state of resources, energy consumption, transportation patterns, waste management, and other vital aspects of urban life.

The collected data is then processed and analyzed using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. This analysis helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that can provide valuable insights into resource utilization and potential areas for improvement.

Data Out refers to the dissemination of this processed information back into the city's infrastructure. The insights gained from data analysis are shared with various stakeholders such as city administrators, planners, policymakers, businesses, residents, and visitors. This sharing can take different forms like interactive dashboards, reports, notifications/alerts on mobile applications or websites.

By making this information easily accessible to all stakeholders in a user-friendly manner, Fab City OS aims to empower them with knowledge about resource consumption patterns and encourage more efficient use of resources. It also allows citizens to actively participate in decision-making processes by providing feedback or suggestions based on their understanding of the data.

The concept of [[DIDO|Data In/Data Out]] in [[Fab City OS]] promotes a more transparent and informed governance model where decisions are backed by accurate data-driven insights. This approach enables cities to become more sustainable by optimizing resource allocation, reducing waste generation, improving energy efficiency, enhancing transportation systems, and fostering a collaborative environment for innovation and problem-solving.
