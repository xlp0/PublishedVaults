The GNU Name System (GNS) is a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and censorship-resistant naming system developed by the GNU project. It aims to provide an alternative to the traditional hierarchical [[Domain Name System]] ([[Domain Name System|DNS]]) used on the internet.

GNS uses a [[DHT|distributed hash table]] ([[DHT]]) to store and retrieve name records. Each name record contains information about a particular name, such as its IP address or other associated data. The DHT allows for decentralized storage and retrieval of these records without relying on centralized DNS servers.

One key feature of GNS is its focus on user privacy. It ensures that users have control over their own names by allowing them to create and manage their own namespaces without relying on third-party registrars or authorities. This means that users can have full ownership and control over their names without fear of censorship or surveillance.

Another important aspect of GNS is its resistance to censorship. Traditional DNS systems are vulnerable to censorship as they rely on centralized authorities who can block or modify domain names. GNS, being decentralized, makes it difficult for any single entity to control or manipulate the naming system.

GNS also provides support for secure name resolution through the use of cryptographic keys and signatures. This helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of name records, protecting against spoofing or tampering.

Overall, the GNU Name System offers an alternative approach to naming on the internet that prioritizes user privacy, decentralization, and censorship resistance. It aims to provide a more democratic and secure naming infrastructure for users worldwide.
