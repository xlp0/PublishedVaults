Name collision in software engineering refers to a situation where two or more entities, such as variables, functions, or classes, have the same name within a particular scope. This can lead to ambiguity and confusion when referencing these entities.

In cryptography, name collision refers to a type of attack where two different inputs produce the same hash value. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be one-way functions, meaning it should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that result in the same hash value. However, if such a pair of inputs is found, it is referred to as a name collision and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities in systems relying on hash functions for integrity checks or digital signatures.
