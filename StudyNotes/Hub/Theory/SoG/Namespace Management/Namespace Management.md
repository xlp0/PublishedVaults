#NSM
Namespace management is the process of organizing and controlling the [[Namespace|namespaces]] within a computer system or software application. A namespace is a container that holds a collection of names, allowing different entities (such as functions, variables, classes, or modules) to have unique identifiers or names within a particular scope.

In namespace management, administrators or developers create and maintain namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and ensure proper organization of code or resources. This involves defining rules and conventions for naming, assigning unique identifiers within namespaces, and handling access control to prevent unauthorized access.

Namespace management is particularly important in large software projects or systems where multiple developers work concurrently. It helps ensure code clarity, modularity, and collaboration by providing a mechanism for separating different components and preventing clashes between their names.
