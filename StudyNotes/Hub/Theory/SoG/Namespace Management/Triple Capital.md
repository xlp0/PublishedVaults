What is Triple Capital in Jeanne-Marie Gescher's term, and please explain in detail what are the three kinds of capitals

In Jeanne-Marie Gescher's term, Triple Capital refers to the three kinds of capitals that exist in society and are essential for its sustainable development. These three kinds of capitals are:

1. Economic Capital: Economic capital refers to financial resources, assets, and infrastructure that contribute to the growth and functioning of an economy. It includes physical capital like buildings, machinery, and technology, as well as financial capital like money, investments, and savings. Economic capital is necessary for generating income, creating jobs, promoting innovation, and supporting economic activities.

2. Human Capital: Human capital encompasses the knowledge, skills, abilities, and health of individuals that contribute to their productivity and ability to participate effectively in society. It includes education levels, training programs, healthcare access, and overall well-being of people. Human capital is crucial for driving economic growth by enhancing productivity, fostering innovation, and promoting social development.

3. Natural Capital: Natural capital refers to the earth's natural resources such as air, water bodies (rivers, lakes), forests, minerals, land fertility, biodiversity (plants and animals), etc. These resources provide various ecosystem services like clean air and water supply, climate regulation, food production systems, medicinal plants for healthcare purposes. Natural capital is vital for sustaining life on earth and plays a significant role in supporting economic activities while maintaining environmental balance.

The concept of Triple Capital emphasizes the interdependence among these three capitals. It highlights that sustainable development can only be achieved by considering economic growth alongside social development (human capital) and environmental conservation (natural capital). Neglecting any one of these capitals can lead to imbalances that can have detrimental effects on society in the long run.

Gescher argues that a holistic approach is necessary to ensure a balance between these capitals. Policies should be designed to promote sustainable economic growth while investing in human capital development through education systems and healthcare programs. Additionally, there should be a focus on preserving and efficiently utilizing natural capital to prevent environmental degradation and ensure the well-being of future generations. By recognizing the importance of Triple Capital, societies can strive for a more sustainable and inclusive future.

## Beyond metrics and landscaping of the work of Jeanne-Marie Gescher?

[[Beyond Metrics|Beyond metrics]] refers to the idea of going beyond traditional numerical measurements and quantitative data when assessing performance or success. It involves taking into account qualitative factors, such as employee satisfaction, customer experience, and social impact, in addition to financial metrics. This concept aligns with Gescher's approach as she emphasizes the importance of considering multiple dimensions when evaluating the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives in organizations.

[[Landscaping]], on the other hand, is a term used by Gescher to describe her approach to sustainability consulting. It involves mapping out a holistic view of an organization's sustainability landscape, identifying key stakeholders, understanding their needs and concerns, and designing strategies that address these various dimensions effectively. Landscaping takes into account not only environmental aspects but also social and economic factors in order to create sustainable solutions.

Both beyond metrics and landscaping are part of Gescher's broader framework for promoting sustainable practices in organizations. By going beyond traditional metrics and adopting a more comprehensive approach through landscaping, she aims to create a more nuanced understanding of sustainability challenges and develop effective strategies for addressing them.
