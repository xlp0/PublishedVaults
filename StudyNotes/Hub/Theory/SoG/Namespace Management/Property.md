In logic and math, the term "property" refers to a characteristic or attribute that is possessed by elements or objects within a given set or domain. Properties can be used to describe and distinguish different elements within a set. For example, in set theory, properties can be used to divide the elements of a set into subsets based on specific criteria. Properties often play a crucial role in defining concepts, proving theorems, and constructing mathematical models.
