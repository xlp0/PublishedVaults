A hash function is a mathematical function that takes in an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal or binary representation. The output, known as the hash value or digest, is unique to the input data, meaning even a small change in the input will produce a significantly different hash value. Hash functions are commonly used in computer science and cryptography for tasks such as data integrity checks, password storage, digital signatures, and data indexing.
