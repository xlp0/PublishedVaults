In the broadest sense of the word, identity refers to the distinguishing characteristics, qualities, or attributes that define an individual or a group. It encompasses various aspects such as personal traits, beliefs, values, cultural affiliations, social roles, and experiences that contribute to one's sense of self and how they perceive themselves in relation to others. Identity can be shaped by factors such as genetics, upbringing, environment, social interactions, and personal choices. It is a complex and multifaceted concept that can vary greatly among individuals and cultures.

# Identity in Logic and Mathematics

In logic and mathematics, the word "identity" refers to the concept that two things are exactly the same or equal. It is typically denoted by the symbol "=" or "â‰¡". When two mathematical expressions, equations, or statements are said to be identical, it means that they represent the same value or have the same [[Property|properties]]. In logic, [[Identity|identity]] is often used to establish equality between different terms or propositions.

## What is Identity in a networked society?

In the context of a networked society, identity refers to how individuals present themselves and establish their online presence. It encompasses the digital representation of one's personal information, characteristics, and activities on various online platforms.

In a networked society, individuals often have multiple online identities across different platforms such as social media, online forums, and professional networks. These identities may be curated to highlight specific aspects of an individual's life or interests. They can include usernames, profile pictures, biographical information, and interactions with others online.

Identity in a networked society also involves the management of privacy and security. Users need to make decisions about what information they share and with whom they share it. They may use privacy settings and authentication methods to protect their digital identities from unauthorized access or misuse.

Moreover, identity in a networked society can also be influenced by algorithms and data collection practices. Online platforms collect data about users' behaviors and preferences to personalize their experiences. This data-driven identity can lead to personalized recommendations but also raises concerns about privacy and potential manipulation.

Overall, identity in a networked society is an evolving concept shaped by digital technologies, social interactions online, and the choices individuals make regarding their online presence.

## What are the models of identity verification?

The models of socio-identity verification are:

1. Knowledge-based verification: This model involves asking the user to provide specific information that only they should know, such as a password, PIN, or answers to security questions.

2. Possession-based verification: In this model, the user is required to possess a physical object or device that verifies their identity. This can include methods like using an ID card, a token or smart card, or a mobile phone with a registered number.

3. Biometric verification: This model utilizes unique physical or behavioral characteristics of an individual to verify their identity. Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice patterns, or iris scans are captured and compared with pre-registered data for authentication.
## What are the models of digital identity?

There are several models of digital identity, including:

1. [[Self-Sovereign Identity]] ([[Self-Sovereign Identity|SSI]]): In this model, individuals have complete control over their digital identities. They can create, manage, and share their identity information as per their own discretion. SSI is based on decentralized technologies like blockchain, where individuals hold their identity credentials and can selectively disclose them to different entities.

2. [[Federated Identity]]: This model involves the use of trusted third-party identity providers (IdPs) that authenticate and validate individuals' identities. The IdPs then share the authenticated information with service providers who rely on them for user authentication. Examples include Single Sign-On (SSO) systems like OAuth or OpenID Connect.

3. User-Centric Identity: This model emphasizes giving users control over their personal data and how it is shared with various entities. Users can manage their identity information through a personal data store and selectively provide access to it when needed.

4. Attribute-Based Identity: This model focuses on breaking down an individual's identity into specific attributes or characteristics rather than a singular identifier. Different attributes are associated with different levels of trust and can be used for authentication or authorization purposes.

5. Enterprise/Corporate Identity: This model revolves around managing digital identities within an organization or enterprise context. It involves user account management, access controls, and permissions based on roles or job functions.

6. Government-Issued Identity: Governments often issue digital identities to citizens for various purposes like e-governance services, voting systems, passports, etc. These identities are typically centrally managed by government authorities.

7. Social Media Identity: Many individuals use social media platforms as a means of digital identification online. These platforms provide authentication services to third-party applications using the user's social media profile information.

It's important to note that these models can overlap or coexist depending on the specific context and requirements of digital identity systems in different domains and applications.
