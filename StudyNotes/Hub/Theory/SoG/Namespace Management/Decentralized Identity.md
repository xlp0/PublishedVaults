[[Decentralized Identity|Decentralized identity]] as a general term refers to a concept and framework that allows individuals to have control over their own digital identities without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries. It involves the use of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger systems to enable individuals to store and manage their personal information in a secure and private manner. There is a more specific term: [[DID]], which refers to a particular implementation protocol defined by [[W3C]].

In a decentralized identity system, individuals have ownership and control over their personal data, including attributes such as name, date of birth, address, and other identifiers. They can choose which entities or organizations can access their data and for what purposes. This gives individuals more autonomy and privacy in managing their digital identities.

Decentralized identity systems also aim to address the problem of identity fragmentation that exists in traditional systems where individuals often have multiple usernames and passwords for different online services. With decentralized identity, individuals can have a single digital identity that can be used across various platforms and services.

Moreover, decentralized identity systems prioritize privacy by design. Personal data is typically stored in encrypted form on the blockchain or distributed ledger, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it. This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information.

# Unique Features

Decentralized identity, also known as [[Self-Sovereign Identity|self-sovereign identity]], differs from [[Centralized Identity|centralized]] and [[Federated Identity|federated identity]] in several ways:

1. Control: In centralized identity systems, such as those used by governments or large organizations, the control over individuals' personal data and identity information lies with a single entity. In federated identity systems, multiple entities share the control to some extent. However, in decentralized identity systems, individuals have full control over their own identities. They can decide what information to share, who can access it, and how it is used.

2. Privacy: Centralized and federated identity systems often require individuals to disclose personal information to various organizations for authentication purposes. This exposes their data to potential risks of misuse or breaches. On the other hand, decentralized identity systems enable users to maintain privacy by sharing only necessary information with specific parties without revealing their entire profile.

3. Interoperability: Centralized and federated identity systems usually have different protocols and standards that can make it challenging for different systems to communicate and exchange user identities seamlessly. Decentralized identity aims to provide interoperability by utilizing open standards like [[DID|W3C's Decentralized Identifiers]] ([[DID|DIDs]]) and [[Verifiable Credential|Verifiable Credentials]] (VCs). This allows identities issued by one system to be recognized and accepted by others without relying on a central authority.

4. Trust: In centralized and federated identity models, trust is primarily placed on the central authority or trusted intermediaries that verify and manage identities. Decentralized identity introduces trust through cryptographic mechanisms like public-key cryptography and blockchain technology. It enables individuals to prove their identities directly without relying on third-party trust intermediaries.

5. Resilience: Centralized systems are vulnerable to single points of failure or attacks that could compromise large amounts of user data or disrupt services entirely. Federated systems offer some resilience but still rely on interconnected entities that may be prone to similar issues. Decentralized identity, on the other hand, distributes identity data across multiple entities or even individual devices, reducing the impact of a single failure or attack.

Overall, [[Decentralized Identity|decentralized identity]] offers individuals more control over their personal data, enhances privacy, improves interoperability between systems, introduces trust through cryptographic mechanisms, and provides resilience against failures and attacks. However, it also poses challenges in terms of user adoption, standardization, and governance that need to be addressed for wider adoption. digital identities by empowering individuals with control over their own data while enhancing privacy and security.

# What is FIDO and how does that relate to Decentralized Identity

[[FIDO]], or [[FIDO|Fast Identity Online]], is an open industry association that aims to develop and promote authentication standards for secure online identification. The FIDO Alliance consists of leading technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, and PayPal, working together to create a stronger and more secure online authentication process.

[[Decentralized Identity]] (DID) is a concept that allows individuals to have control over their own identity data without relying on centralized authorities like governments or corporations. DID enables users to store their identity information in a decentralized manner using blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies.

FIDO and Decentralized Identity are related in the sense that both aim to enhance the security and privacy of digital identities. FIDO provides standardized protocols for strong authentication methods such as biometrics and hardware tokens, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access their digital accounts. Decentralized Identity complements FIDO by providing a framework for individuals to manage their identity data securely and selectively share it with others as needed.

By combining FIDO's strong authentication standards with Decentralized Identity's user-centric approach to identity management, individuals can have greater control over their online identities while still benefiting from robust security measures. This combination enhances privacy, reduces reliance on centralized identity providers, and mitigates the risks associated with password-based authentication systems.
