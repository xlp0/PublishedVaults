A paradigm shift refers to a fundamental change in the way people view and understand the world, often resulting from new discoveries, advancements, or shifts in societal values. It represents a complete transformation in the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and methodologies that guide thinking and behavior within a particular field or society as a whole.

The term "paradigm shift" was coined by [[Thomas Kuhn]], an American physicist and philosopher of science, in his influential book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" published in 1962. Kuhn argued that scientific progress does not occur through a linear accumulation of knowledge but rather through revolutionary shifts in thinking. He proposed that scientific communities operate within specific paradigms or dominant frameworks of thought until anomalies arise that cannot be explained by existing theories. These anomalies lead to a crisis, which eventually results in the emergence of a new paradigm that better explains the phenomena.

Kuhn's concept of paradigm shifts has been extended beyond scientific disciplines and is now widely used to describe transformative changes across various domains such as technology, business, culture, and society. It highlights the significance of challenging established beliefs and embracing new ways of thinking to drive progress and innovation.
