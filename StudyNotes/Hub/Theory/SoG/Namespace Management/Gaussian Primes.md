Gaussian primes are a type of complex number that is prime within the set of Gaussian integers. The Gaussian integers are formed by extending the set of regular integers to include complex numbers in the form of a + bi, where a and b are both integers.

In the case of Gaussian primes, they are complex numbers that cannot be factored into non-unit Gaussian integers. In other words, they are complex numbers that cannot be expressed as a product of two non-unit Gaussian integers.

To determine whether a complex number is a Gaussian prime, one can use the following criteria:
1. If both the real and imaginary parts of the number are nonzero, it is prime if it cannot be divided evenly by any other Gaussian integer.
2. If only the real part is nonzero, it is prime if it is a regular prime in the set of regular integers.
3. If only the imaginary part is nonzero, it is prime if its magnitude squared (the sum of squares of its real and imaginary parts) is a regular prime.

For example, some examples of Gaussian primes include:
- 1 + i: This complex number has both real and imaginary parts as non-zero integers and cannot be factored further within the set of Gaussian integers.
- 2 + i: This complex number has both real and imaginary parts as non-zero integers and also cannot be factored further within the set of Gaussian integers.
- 3: This complex number has only a non-zero real part and is considered prime if it is not divisible by any other regular integer. In this case, 3 itself is a regular prime.

Gaussian primes have several interesting properties and applications in number theory, algebraic geometry, cryptography, and coding theory. They play an important role in various mathematical concepts such as unique factorization domains and arithmetic progressions.
