The surveillance economy refers to an economic system in which companies profit by collecting and analyzing personal data from individuals for various purposes, such as targeted advertising, market research, and behavioral manipulation. These companies typically use digital technologies and platforms to collect vast amounts of data from users' online activities, including their browsing habits, social media interactions, location data, and more.

The collected data is then analyzed and used to create detailed profiles of individuals, enabling companies to tailor their products, services, and advertisements specifically to each user. This personalized approach aims to increase the effectiveness of marketing strategies and ultimately drive higher profits for the companies involved.

Critics argue that the surveillance economy raises serious concerns regarding privacy invasion and the exploitation of personal information without consent. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for abuse or misuse of the collected data by both private companies and governments.

Overall, the surveillance economy highlights the increasing reliance on personal data collection as a significant driver of profit in today's digital age.
