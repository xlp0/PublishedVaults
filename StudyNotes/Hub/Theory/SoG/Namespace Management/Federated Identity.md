Federated Identity, also known as Federated Identity Management (FIM), refers to a system or framework that allows users to access multiple applications or systems using a single set of digital identities or credentials. It enables users to authenticate once with their identity provider (IdP) and then access various services without the need for separate login credentials for each service.

In a federated identity model, the authentication process is decentralized. It involves multiple trusted organizations or entities, known as [[Identity Provider|Identity Providers]] (IdPs), that establish a trust relationship with each other. These IdPs authenticate the users and provide them with security tokens that vouch for their identity and attributes.

On the other hand, [[Centralized Identity]] is an approach where user identities and access control are managed by a single authority or organization. In this model, all authentication and authorization processes are handled by a central entity known as the Identity Provider (IdP). Users have a single set of login credentials that grant them access to various applications and services within the centralized system.

The primary difference between Federated Identity and Centralized Identity lies in how authentication is managed. In Federated Identity, authentication is distributed across multiple trusted parties, whereas in Centralized Identity, it is controlled by a central authority.

[[Federated Identity]] offers several advantages over [[Centralized Identity]], including:

1. Single Sign-On (SSO): Users only need to authenticate once with their IdP and can then seamlessly access multiple applications or services without repeatedly entering login credentials.

2. Reduced administrative overhead: Since user identities are managed by multiple IdPs in federated systems, individual service providers do not need to manage user accounts themselves. This reduces administrative tasks such as user provisioning and password resets.

3. Enhanced security: Federated systems can leverage advanced authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) provided by IdPs, improving overall security compared to relying on a single centralized system.

4. Scalability: Federated Identity allows for the integration of new applications or services without requiring significant changes to the existing system. This scalability is beneficial in scenarios where multiple organizations collaborate or where new services are added over time.

In summary, Federated Identity enables users to have a unified digital identity across multiple systems, reducing the need for separate login credentials and improving user experience. It offers benefits such as SSO, reduced administrative overhead, enhanced security, and scalability when compared to [[Centralized Identity]].
