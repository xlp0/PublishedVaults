A [[DHT|Distributed Hash Table]] ([[DHT]]) is a decentralized distributed system that enables efficient lookup, storage, and retrieval of data in a peer-to-peer network. It provides a key-value store where each node in the network is responsible for storing and managing a subset of the data.

In a DHT, data is distributed across multiple nodes using a hash function. The hash function maps each key to a unique identifier, which determines the node responsible for storing that key-value pair. This ensures that each piece of data is assigned to a specific node based on its identifier.

The main advantages of using a DHT include scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing. Since data is distributed across multiple nodes, the system can scale to accommodate large amounts of data without any central bottleneck. Additionally, if a node fails or leaves the network, other nodes can still provide access to the data by redistributing the responsibility for the lost node's keys.

DHTs also provide efficient lookup operations by allowing direct routing to the node responsible for storing a specific key-value pair. Instead of searching through all nodes in the network, nodes use routing tables or other overlay network structures to quickly find the correct destination.

There are various DHT algorithms and protocols available, such as Chord, Kademlia, and [[CAN]] ([[CAN|Content Addressable Network]]). These algorithms differ in their approach to routing and managing data distribution but share common principles of decentralization and scalability.

Overall, Distributed Hash Tables are powerful tools for building decentralized systems that can efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data in a robust and fault-tolerant manner. They have been widely used in peer-to-peer file sharing networks, content delivery networks (CDNs), distributed databases, and other distributed systems applications.
