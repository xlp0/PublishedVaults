A [[Namespace]] is a container that organizes a set of related identifiers or names in a computer program. It helps to avoid naming conflicts and provides a way to group and organize code elements such as functions, classes, variables, and other identifiers. Namespaces are commonly used in programming languages to create modular and organized code structures. They allow developers to define unique names for different parts of their program, making it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate on the codebase.
