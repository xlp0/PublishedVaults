This paper was written by cognitive psychologist [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] and published in 1956 in the journal Psychological Review.

In the paper, Miller explores the limits of human short-term memory and cognitive processing. He presents the idea that there is a cognitive limit to the number of meaningful chunks of information that an average person can hold and process at any given time.

Miller discusses various studies and experiments conducted at the time to understand the capacity of human memory and cognitive processing. He notes that people can typically remember and process around seven meaningful items, give or take two, hence the term "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two."

Miller argues that this cognitive limit arises because the human mind tends to process information in chunks rather than as individual items. Chunks are meaningful units that can be grouped together, such as words, phrases, or familiar concepts. By organizing information into these chunks, the mind can better handle and remember larger amounts of information.

The paper had a significant impact on the field of cognitive psychology and influenced subsequent research on human memory, attention, and information processing. It highlighted the importance of understanding the limitations of human cognition and the need to consider the organization and structure of information for effective memory and processing.

It's worth noting that while Miller's paper provided valuable insights into the capacity of human working memory, subsequent research has suggested that the actual capacity might vary depending on various factors, such as the nature of the information, individual differences, and the use of memory strategies. Nonetheless, Miller's paper remains a seminal work in the field and sparked further investigations into the limits and organization of human memory and cognition.
