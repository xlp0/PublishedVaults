Tri Hita Karana is a traditional [[Bali|Balinese]] philosophy that promotes harmony and balance in life. It is a guiding principle that encompasses three sources of well-being and happiness. The term "Tri Hita Karana" itself is derived from the Sanskrit language and can be broken down as follows:

1. Tri: "Tri" means three. In this context, it represents the three elements or sources of harmony.

2. Hita: "Hita" refers to happiness, welfare, or well-being.

3. Karana: "Karana" means the cause or method.

Together, [[Tri Hita Karana 1]] translates to "the three causes of well-being" or "the three paths to happiness."

The three elements of Tri Hita Karana are:

1. Harmony with God (Parhyangan): This aspect emphasizes the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship with the spiritual realm, including gods, ancestors, and the divine. Balinese people express their devotion through various religious ceremonies, rituals, and offerings to seek blessings and protection from the spiritual entities.

2. Harmony with Nature (Palemahan): This element focuses on living in harmony with the environment and nature. Balinese culture and customs promote sustainable practices and rituals that respect and preserve the natural world. It includes maintaining cleanliness, protecting natural resources, and showing reverence for the earth and its elements.

3. Harmony with Others (Pawongan): The third aspect of Tri Hita Karana emphasizes the importance of cultivating harmonious relationships with fellow human beings. This involves promoting social harmony, cooperation, and mutual support among individuals and communities. Balinese society places a strong emphasis on community values, family bonds, and collective well-being.

Tri Hita Karana is deeply ingrained in Balinese culture and has guided the way of life on the island for generations. It shapes various aspects of Balinese traditions, ceremonies, social structures, and daily practices. The philosophy reflects the Balinese people's holistic understanding of life, where the balance and harmony among these three elements are believed to lead to a fulfilled and contented existence.
