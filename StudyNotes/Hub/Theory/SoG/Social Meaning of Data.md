Operationally, socially meaningful data means that data generation, collection, and interpretation are given socially-liable [[Identity|identities]]. More importantly, these identity data should have a way to be verified, or so called "[[Verifiable Credential|verifiable credentials]]"([[Verifiable Credential|VC]]).

In a broader sense, the social meaning of data refers to the significance and impact that data has on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. In today's digital era, data plays a crucial role in various aspects of our lives, including communication, decision-making, and social interactions.

Data has become a valuable asset for businesses, governments, and organizations as it provides insights into consumer behavior, trends, and preferences. This information helps in developing targeted marketing strategies, improving products and services, and making informed policy decisions. The social meaning of data in this context relates to its ability to shape and influence economic activities, employment opportunities, and market dynamics.

Data also has a significant impact on personal relationships and social interactions. Social media platforms rely heavily on user-generated data to create personalized experiences for individuals. Likes, comments, shares, and other forms of engagement generate data that is used to understand user preferences and tailor content accordingly. This creates a sense of validation or social recognition for individuals while contributing to the formation of online communities.

However, the social meaning of data also raises concerns related to privacy, surveillance, and ethical implications. The collection and analysis of personal data raise questions about consent, ownership rights, transparency, and potential misuse. Data breaches or unauthorized access can lead to identity theft or manipulation of personal information.

Furthermore, the social meaning of data extends beyond individual experiences as it plays a role in shaping public opinion and influencing societal issues. Data-driven journalism utilizes large datasets to uncover patterns or trends that inform public discourse on topics such as politics, health care systems, climate change, or inequality. Data can challenge existing narratives or shed light on hidden realities.

In summary, the social meaning of data encompasses its economic value as well as its influence on personal relationships and societal issues. While it offers benefits such as personalized experiences or improved decision-making processes when used responsibly; it also raises concerns about privacy rights and ethical considerations in an increasingly data-driven world.
