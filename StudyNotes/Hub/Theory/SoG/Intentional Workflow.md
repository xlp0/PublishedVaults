#intention

Intentional Workflow is an idea derived from [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]. Intentions can be identified using [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] proofs associated with [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]], such as [[Digital Signature|digital signature]] that verifies the intention of certain actions. 

## Focus Intention on Correctness
To express one's intention, the notion of [[Correctness|correctness]] specificiation and verification must be discussed. In other words, [[Intention|intentions]] should be documented with explicit [[Smart Contract|contracts]].

### Relating to Zettlekasten Method
The [[Zettlekasten Workflow]], developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]], is a note-taking and knowledge management system that aims to support creative thinking, idea generation, and knowledge organization. It involves the creation of interconnected notes or "zettel" that capture individual ideas, concepts, or pieces of information. These notes are then linked together to form a network of interconnected knowledge.

While the Zettelkasten method is not inherently related to program correctness or verification as presented by Tony Hoare, we can explore a hypothetical representation of an intentional workflow using the concept of program correctness.

In this representation, we can view an intentional workflow in the context of software development or system design. The Zettelkasten notes can be seen as representations of program requirements, specifications, design decisions, and other relevant information. Each note captures a specific aspect of the system, such as a requirement or a design constraint.

To relate this to program correctness, we can consider the following:

1. Specification: Each Zettelkasten note represents a specific requirement or specification for the system. These specifications outline the desired behavior, inputs, outputs, and constraints of the program.
    
2. Design: The Zettelkasten network captures the design decisions and architectural choices made during the intentional workflow. It represents how different components and modules of the system are connected and interact with each other.
    
3. Verification: Program correctness can be addressed by employing verification techniques to ensure that the system behaves as intended. This involves checking if the interconnected notes and their associated requirements are met by the actual program implementation. Formal methods, testing, and code review can be used to verify the correctness of the system.
    
4. Iterative Refinement: The Zettelkasten workflow allows for iterative refinement and improvement of the system. As new information or ideas emerge, new notes can be added, existing notes can be modified, and connections between notes can be adjusted. This iterative process aligns with the iterative nature of software development and verification.
    

By incorporating program correctness principles into the intentional workflow represented by the Zettelkasten method, we can emphasize the importance of ensuring that the implemented system meets the intended requirements and behaves correctly. Verification techniques, such as formal [[Verification|verification]] or testing, can be applied to validate the [[Correctness|correctness]] of the system and identify potential issues or deviations from the specifications captured in the Zettelkasten notes.

It's worth noting that this representation is a hypothetical interpretation, as the Zettelkasten method is not inherently tied to program correctness. However, by relating the intentional workflow to program correctness principles, we can highlight the significance of ensuring that the implemented system aligns with the specified requirements and behaves as intended.
