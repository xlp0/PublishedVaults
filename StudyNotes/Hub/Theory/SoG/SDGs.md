#SDGs

[[SDGs]], or [[SDGs|Sustainable Development Goals]], are a set of 17 global goals adopted by United Nations member states in 2015. These goals are meant to be achieved by the year 2030 and aim to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world.

The SDGs build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were established in 2000 but have a broader scope and more ambitious targets. They cover a wide range of issues including poverty eradication, quality education, gender equality, clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, climate action, responsible consumption and production, and more.

The 17 SDGs are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They recognize that development should be balanced across economic, social, and environmental dimensions to ensure long-term sustainability. The goals also emphasize the importance of inclusivity and leaving no one behind.

Each goal has specific targets and indicators to measure progress. Governments are primarily responsible for implementing these goals within their countries but collaboration between governments, businesses, civil society organizations, and individuals is crucial for their successful achievement.

The SDGs provide a comprehensive framework for global development efforts with a focus on ending poverty in all its forms while ensuring a healthy planet for future generations. They serve as a guide for policymakers and stakeholders to work towards creating a more just, equitable, and sustainable world by addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.
