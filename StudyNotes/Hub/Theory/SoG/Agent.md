In the context of [[Michael Levin|Michael Levin's]] work, an "agent" refers to a concept in the field of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Michael Levin is not specifically known for his work in this area, but if we generalize the term "agent" in the field of AI, it typically refers to a software or hardware entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve specific goals.

An agent can be a program running on a computer, a robot, or any other system that is designed to interact with its surroundings and make decisions based on its observations. The agent may have sensors to gather information about the environment and actuators to perform actions. The goal of the agent is to maximize its performance in achieving a particular objective or set of objectives.

In the context of Michael Levin's work, it would be helpful to provide more specific information or clarify if there is a particular context or concept related to agents that you are referring to.

In [[Donald Hoffman|Donald Hoffman's]] work, the term "[[Agent|agent]]" is used to refer to conscious beings or entities that have the capacity for perception, decision-making, and action within the context of his theory of perception.

According to Hoffman's theory, our perceptions are not direct representations of an objective reality but rather a user interface that has evolved to support our survival and reproductive fitness. These perceptual interfaces, or what Hoffman calls "[[Consciousness|conscious agents]]," are the entities that interact with the world and make sense of the information presented to them.

In this framework, being an agent means having the ability to perceive and interact with the perceptual interface. It implies that conscious beings have an active role in shaping their perceptions and making decisions based on those perceptions. Agents in Hoffman's work possess a subjective experience and engage with the world through their conscious awareness.

Hoffman argues that the nature of [[Consciousness|consciousness]] and perception is not purely passive or receptive but involves active interpretation, construction, and engagement with the perceptual interface. Thus, being an agent in Hoffman's work implies having the capacity for conscious experience and the ability to actively participate in the process of perception and decision-making.

It's important to note that Hoffman's theories on perception and consciousness are complex and nuanced, and the concept of being an agent within his work may have further depth and subtleties that are explored in his writings and research.

### Comparing Levin with Hoffman's views on agent and agency
While Michael Levin and Donald Hoffman approach the concept of "[[Agency|agency]]" from different perspectives, there are some overarching connections between their notions of agents and agency:

1. Autonomy and Decision-making: Both Levin and Hoffman recognize that agents possess some level of autonomy and decision-making capability. In Levin's work on artificial intelligence, an agent is a software or hardware entity that perceives its environment and takes actions based on its observations, while in Hoffman's work on consciousness, agents are conscious beings that actively interact with their perceptual interface and make decisions. In both cases, agency involves the ability to act and make choices.

2. Goal-directed Behavior: In the context of agency, both Levin and Hoffman consider agents as entities that act with specific goals or objectives in mind. In Levin's AI framework, an agent's actions are driven by its objective or set of objectives, while in Hoffman's theory of perception, conscious agents interact with their environment to support their survival and reproductive fitness. Agency, in both cases, implies purposeful behavior aligned with specific goals.

3. Perception and Interpretation: Both Levin and Hoffman acknowledge the role of perception and interpretation in agency. In Levin's AI context, agents perceive their environment through sensors and make decisions based on their observations. In Hoffman's theory, conscious agents interact with their perceptual interface, which shapes their subjective experiences and influences their decision-making process. Agency, in this sense, relies on the interpretation and understanding of sensory information.

It's important to note that while there are these general similarities, Levin's work primarily focuses on artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, whereas Hoffman's work centers around perception and consciousness. Therefore, the specific details and implications of agency within their respective frameworks will vary.
