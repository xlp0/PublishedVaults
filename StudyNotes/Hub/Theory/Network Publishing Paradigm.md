## Abstract
This paper presents a [[Network Publishing Paradigm]] ([[Network Publishing Paradigm|NPP]]) as a framework for building large scale
Internet and Intranet (INET) systems. It changes the traditional function-centered information
systems design paradigm by integrating content-centered design disciplines. NPP also categorizes
the web site construction tasks into five different domains. We propose a layered methodology for
web authoring where each domain is mapped onto a specific software layer. To maximize the
utilization of layered software architecture, NPP modularizes technical elements and packages
human expertise into interchangeable units that allow the construction of network publishing
environments to be highly flexible and scaleable. These qualities, coupled with secure production
protocols, are essential to commercial transactions on the INET. The NPP is a comprehensive
development methodology that enables organizations to adopt late breaking technologies with
minimal financial risks and managerial uncertainty.
