Maxwell's equations are a set of fundamental equations in classical [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] that describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and propagate through space. They were formulated by the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century and played a pivotal role in the development of our understanding of electricity, magnetism, and light.

Maxwell's equations consist of four equations, which can be written in either integral or differential form. Here, I'll present them in their differential form, which is more commonly used:

1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields:
   ∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀

   This equation relates the electric field (E) to the electric charge density (ρ) in a given region of space. It states that the divergence of the electric field is equal to the ratio of the charge density to the electric constant (ε₀), which represents the permittivity of free space.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields:
   ∇ ⋅ B = 0

   This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field (B) is always zero. It implies that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated magnetic charges) and that magnetic field lines always form closed loops.

3. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:
   ∇ × E = -∂B / ∂t

   This equation describes the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction. It states that a changing magnetic field (B) induces an electric field (E), and the induced electric field is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field over time.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition:
   ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E / ∂t

   This equation combines the effects of electric currents (J) and changing electric fields (E) on the magnetic field (B). The term μ₀ represents the magnetic constant (permeability of free space). The left-hand side of the equation relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current density and the rate of change of the electric field.

These four equations encapsulate the fundamental principles of electromagnetism. They describe how electric charges create electric fields, how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields, and how electric currents and changing electric fields generate magnetic fields. Together, they provide a unified description of electricity, magnetism, and their interplay.

Maxwell's equations also have profound implications beyond classical electromagnetism. When [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] combined these equations with the wave equation, he discovered that electromagnetic waves, including light, are manifestations of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. This discovery unified the understanding of electricity, magnetism, and optics, paving the way for the development of the theory of light as an electromagnetic wave.
