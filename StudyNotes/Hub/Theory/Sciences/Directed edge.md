In computer science, a directed edge, also known as a directed arc or a directed link, is a concept used in graph theory to represent a relationship or connection between two nodes (vertices) in a directed graph.

A directed graph, or digraph, consists of a set of nodes and a set of directed edges. Each directed edge connects two nodes and has a specific direction or orientation, indicated by an arrowhead. The direction of the arrowhead indicates the direction of the relationship or the flow of information, resources, or control between the nodes.

The directed edge in a computer science context captures a unidirectional relationship, indicating that there is a connection from one node (the source or tail) to another node (the target or head). The directed edge provides a way to model and represent asymmetric relationships, where information, influence, or control flows in a particular direction. In [[Category theory|category theory]], a [[Directed edge|directed edge]] denotes a [[Morphism|morphism]].

Directed edges are commonly used in various areas of computer science, including:

1. Graph Algorithms: Directed edges play a crucial role in graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), where the direction of edges determines the traversal order and exploration of nodes in the graph.
    
2. Data Structures: Directed edges are used in various data structures based on graphs, such as directed adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. These data structures efficiently represent and store the relationships between nodes in directed graphs.
    
3. Network Communication: In networking, directed edges can represent the flow of data packets or messages between network nodes, indicating the direction of communication or the routing of information.
    
4. Control Flow: Directed edges can be used to model the control flow of programs, where the edges represent the order of execution or the flow of control between different parts of the program.
    

The use of directed edges in computer science allows for the representation and analysis of directed relationships or dependencies in various contexts. It enables the study of directed graphs, their properties, and algorithms to analyze or traverse them efficiently.
