[[Awareness]] refers to the state of being [[Consciousness|conscious]] or [[Cognitive Science|cognizant ]] of something. It involves the subjective experience of perceiving, sensing, or knowing something, whether it is internal mental states, external stimuli, or the surrounding environment.

In the context of consciousness, awareness is often considered a fundamental aspect. Consciousness encompasses the overall state of being aware, including both self-awareness (awareness of one's own thoughts, emotions, and existence) and awareness of the external world.

While awareness and consciousness are closely related, there can be subtle distinctions between the two:

1. Awareness as a Subset of Consciousness: Some theories consider awareness as a subset of consciousness, where consciousness encompasses a broader range of mental processes, including not only awareness but also higher-order cognitive functions, self-reflection, introspection, and subjective experiences.
    
2. Levels of Awareness: Awareness can exist at different levels, ranging from basic sensory awareness (e.g., being aware of a visual stimulus) to more complex forms of self-awareness (e.g., being aware of one's thoughts, emotions, or personal identity). Consciousness, on the other hand, can be understood as a continuum that encompasses these varying levels of awareness.
    
3. Implicit vs. Explicit Awareness: Awareness can be implicit or explicit. Implicit awareness refers to unconscious or automatic processing of information without explicit conscious awareness. Explicit awareness, on the other hand, involves conscious attention and explicit recognition of the information.
    

It is important to note that awareness and consciousness are complex phenomena that are still subjects of active research and philosophical inquiry. The nature and mechanisms of consciousness and awareness continue to be explored and debated in fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.

Understanding awareness and consciousness is a multidisciplinary endeavor, combining insights from subjective experience, behavioral observations, brain imaging, and theoretical frameworks. Researchers aim to unravel the neural correlates, cognitive processes, and philosophical implications of these phenomena to gain a deeper understanding of human consciousness and the nature of subjective experience.
