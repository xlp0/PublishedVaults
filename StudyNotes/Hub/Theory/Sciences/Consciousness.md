The definition of consciousness in science and philosophical literature can vary, as it is a complex and debated concept. However, there are some common elements that are often discussed.

In scientific literature, consciousness is generally understood as the state of being [[Awareness|aware]] and perceiving one's own existence, surroundings, thoughts, and sensations. It involves the ability to have subjective experiences and to process information from the external world and internal mental states.

Philosophically, consciousness refers to the subjective experience of being aware and having mental states. It involves [[self-awareness]], [[Intentional Workflow|intentionality]] (the ability to be about something), and [[Qualia]] (the subjective qualities of our experiences).

There are different theories and approaches to understanding consciousness in both science and philosophy. Some theories propose that it emerges from brain activity or neural processes, while others suggest it may be a fundamental aspect of the universe. These theories often explore topics such as the nature of consciousness, its relationship to the physical world, and its role in human cognition and behavior.

It is important to note that there is ongoing research and debate in these fields regarding the precise definition and understanding of consciousness.
