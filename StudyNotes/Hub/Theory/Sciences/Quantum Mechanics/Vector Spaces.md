A vector space is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of vectors along with operations of addition and scalar multiplication. It is defined over a field, which could be the real numbers (R) or complex numbers (C). 

In a vector space, vectors can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce new vectors that still belong to the same vector space. The addition operation satisfies properties like commutativity, associativity, and the existence of an additive identity element. The scalar multiplication operation also satisfies properties like distributivity and compatibility with field multiplication.

Additionally, a vector space must satisfy certain axioms, such as closure under addition and scalar multiplication, existence of additive inverse for each vector, and compatibility between operations.

Examples of vector spaces include Euclidean spaces (R^n), where vectors are tuples of real numbers; function spaces, where vectors are functions; and polynomial spaces, where vectors are polynomials.

Vector spaces have various applications in mathematics and physics, including linear algebra, differential equations, optimization problems, quantum mechanics, and computer graphics.
