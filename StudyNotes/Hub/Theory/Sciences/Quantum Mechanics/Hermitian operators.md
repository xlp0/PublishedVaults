In mathematics, particularly in [[Linear Algebra|linear algebra]] and complex analysis, a Hermitian operator (or Hermitian matrix) is a special type of matrix or linear operator that satisfies a specific symmetry condition. It is named after the French mathematician Charles Hermite.

A complex square matrix A is said to be Hermitian if its transpose conjugate is equal to itself. In other words, a matrix A is Hermitian if it satisfies the following property:

A^† = A

where A^† denotes the conjugate transpose (also known as the adjoint or conjugate adjoint) of A.

More explicitly, if A is an n x n complex matrix with entries a_ij (where i and j range from 1 to n), then A^† is obtained by taking the complex conjugate of each element and then transposing the resulting matrix. The condition A^† = A can be written as:

a_ij* = a_ji   for all i and j

where a_ij* represents the complex conjugate of the element a_ij.

For a Hermitian operator, the diagonal elements of the matrix (i.e., a_ii) must be real numbers, and the off-diagonal elements (i.e., a_ij where i ≠ j) must have complex conjugates such that a_ij* = a_ji.

In quantum mechanics, Hermitian operators play a crucial role as they represent physical observables. For example, observables like position, momentum, energy, and angular momentum in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitian operators have important physical interpretations, and the eigenstates corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.

Hermitian operators are also related to self-adjoint operators, which are defined on a more general notion of an inner product space. In a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space (a special case of an inner product space), Hermitian operators are equivalent to self-adjoint operators.

The Hermitian property is an important concept in various areas of mathematics and physics, including [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], signal processing, and quantum information theory. Its [[Symmetry|symmetry]] properties and connection to real eigenvalues make it a fundamental aspect of many mathematical and physical theories.
