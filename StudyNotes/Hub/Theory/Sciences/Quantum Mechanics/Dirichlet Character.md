In number theory, a Dirichlet character is a function defined on the positive integers that generalizes the notion of a quadratic character. It is named after the German mathematician [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], who introduced and extensively studied these characters in the 19th century.

Formally, a Dirichlet character modulo m is a function χ: ℕ → ℂ defined on the positive integers, where m is a positive integer. The value of χ(n) depends on both n and m and satisfies certain properties:

1. Periodicity: χ(n + m) = χ(n) for all n ∈ ℕ.
2. Multiplicativity: If gcd(a, m) = 1 and gcd(b, m) = 1, then χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b).

These properties allow us to extend the definition of a Dirichlet character to all positive integers.

There are two types of Dirichlet characters:

1. Primitive characters: A Dirichlet character modulo m is called primitive if it cannot be expressed as a power of another Dirichlet character modulo m. Primitive characters form a group under multiplication called the group of primitive characters modulo m.

2. Non-primitive characters: Any Dirichlet character modulo m can be expressed as a power of some primitive character modulo m.

The most commonly studied case is when the modulus m is prime. In this case, there are exactly φ(m-1) primitive characters modulo m, where φ denotes Euler's totient function.

Dirichlet characters have numerous applications in number theory. They play a crucial role in proving many important results such as Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions and Gauss' quadratic reciprocity law. They also have connections to other areas of mathematics such as algebraic number theory and representation theory.

Overall, Dirichlet characters provide powerful tools for studying various properties of integers and their relationships with prime numbers.
