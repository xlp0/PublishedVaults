#wavefunction
In [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], a wave function (often denoted by the Greek letter Ψ, psi) is a mathematical function that describes the behavior of a quantum system. It contains information about the state of a particle or a physical system and allows us to make predictions about its properties, behavior, and the outcomes of measurements.

The wave function is a complex-valued function of the spatial coordinates and time. For example, for a single particle in three-dimensional space, the wave function would be represented as Ψ(x, y, z, t), where (x, y, z) are the spatial coordinates, and t is the time. The absolute square of the wave function, |Ψ(x, y, z, t)|^2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position (x, y, z) at time t.

The behavior of the wave function is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which is a partial differential equation describing how the wave function evolves over time. The Schrödinger equation is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and provides the basis for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems.

It is important to note that the wave function's complex nature implies that it contains both amplitude and phase information. The square of the amplitude of the wave function gives the probability density, while the phase information is crucial in determining interference patterns and other quantum phenomena.

In quantum mechanics, the wave function plays a central role in making predictions about a system's behavior. For example, the wave function can be used to determine the probabilities of finding a particle in different states or obtaining specific measurement outcomes. When a measurement is made on a quantum system, the wave function "collapses" into one of the possible measurement outcomes, according to the probabilities defined by the [[Born Rule]].

The concept of the wave function is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has led to a profound shift in our understanding of the behavior of particles and physical systems at the microscopic scale. It forms the foundation for the description of quantum states, quantum superposition, entanglement, and the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.
