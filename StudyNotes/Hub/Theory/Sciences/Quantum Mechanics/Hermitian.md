In quantum mechanics, a Hermitian operator refers to an operator that satisfies the condition of being self-adjoint. This means that the operator is equal to its own adjoint or Hermitian conjugate.

Mathematically, for an operator A, if A† denotes its adjoint (which is obtained by taking the complex conjugate of each element and then transposing the matrix), then A is Hermitian if and only if A = A†.

In terms of physical interpretation, Hermitian operators play a crucial role in quantum mechanics because their eigenvalues are always real. This property ensures that observables in quantum systems, such as energy or momentum, are represented by Hermitian operators since measurable quantities must yield real values.

Additionally, the eigenvectors associated with different eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are orthogonal to each other. This orthogonality property allows for the construction of a complete set of orthogonal basis vectors that can be used to describe a quantum system's state.

Overall, in quantum mechanics, Hermitian operators serve as a mathematical framework for representing observables and studying the properties of quantum systems.
