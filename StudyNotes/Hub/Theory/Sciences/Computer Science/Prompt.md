In the world of Generative AI, a prompt is a textual or visual input that serves as an instruction or starting point for the AI model to generate content. It can be a sentence, a paragraph, an image, or any other form of input that provides guidance to the model about what kind of output is expected. The prompt essentially sets the context and tone for the generated content and influences the AI's creative process. The quality and specificity of the prompt have a significant impact on the generated output. By manipulating or adjusting prompts, users can influence the style, topic, sentiment, or other characteristics of the generated content.
