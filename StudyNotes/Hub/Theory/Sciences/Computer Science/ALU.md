An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a key component of a computer's central processing unit ([[CPU]]). It is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on binary data. The ALU performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

The ALU operates on binary inputs, which are typically represented using electrical voltages or digital signals. It processes these inputs based on the instructions provided by the computer's control unit. The result of the operation is then stored in registers or memory for further processing or output.

The ALU plays a crucial role in executing computer programs and performing calculations required by the CPU. It enables computers to perform mathematical calculations, make decisions based on logical conditions, and manipulate data efficiently.
