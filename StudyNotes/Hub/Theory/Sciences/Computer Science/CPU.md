A CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside the computer. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. The CPU carries out instructions from a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations. It interprets and executes instructions from the computer's memory to perform tasks such as calculations, data processing, and running software applications.

## How is CPU related to the von Neumann Architecture?

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a key component of the [[von Neumann Architecture]]. In this architecture, the CPU is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.

The von Neumann Architecture is a basic blueprint for designing computers, named after the mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann. It consists of four main components: the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and a control unit.

The CPU acts as the "brain" of the computer and is responsible for fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, executing them, and storing the results back in memory. It consists of an arithmetic logic unit ([[ALU]]) that performs mathematical calculations and logical operations, as well as control circuits that manage the flow of data and instructions.

The CPU interacts with other components of the von Neumann Architecture to carry out its tasks. It retrieves instructions from memory using an address provided by the control unit. Once fetched, it decodes these instructions to understand what operation needs to be performed. The ALU then executes the instruction by manipulating data stored in memory or registers.
