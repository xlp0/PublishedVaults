Please tell me about context-sensitive language in Computer Science terms

In Computer Science, a [[Context-sensitive language|context-sensitive language]] refers to a type of formal language that is defined by a set of rules or grammar that takes into account the context or surrounding environment in which a particular symbol or word appears. 

Context-sensitive languages are more expressive than regular languages and context-free languages, as they allow for more complex patterns and structures to be recognized and generated. They are often used in programming languages, natural language processing, and compiler design.

The defining characteristic of a context-sensitive language is the presence of production rules that can change the symbols within a string based on the surrounding symbols. These rules are often represented using formal grammars such as [[Backus-Naur Form]] ([[Backus-Naur Form|BNF]]) or Augmented BNF (ABNF).

In context-sensitive grammars, each production rule has one or more conditions on the left-hand side called contexts, which specify the required symbols before and after the symbol being replaced. When these conditions are met, the production rule is applied to transform the original string.

Formally, a language L is considered context-sensitive if there exists a non-deterministic linear bounded automaton (LBA) that can recognize it. An LBA is a theoretical computational model that has access to an input tape with read-write capabilities but with limited space to store information.

Context-sensitive languages have applications in various areas of computer science. In programming language design, they are used to define syntax and semantics rules for compilers and interpreters. In natural language processing, they help analyze and generate human languages by considering the surrounding words and grammar rules. Additionally, they are also used in formal verification techniques for verifying software systems' [[Correctness|correctness]].

Overall, context-sensitive languages play an important role in computer science by providing powerful tools for defining complex patterns and structures in various domains such as programming languages, natural language processing, and formal verification.
