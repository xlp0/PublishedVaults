In computer science, consensus refers to the process of reaching an agreement or a shared decision among a group of participants or nodes in a distributed system. It involves finding a common understanding or state that all parties can agree upon.

Consensus algorithms are used in various computer science applications, particularly in distributed systems and blockchain technology. They ensure that all nodes in the system agree on the order and validity of transactions or events, even in the presence of failures, delays, or malicious actors.

The goal of consensus is to establish trust and maintain consistency across the network by ensuring that all participants have a consistent view of the system state. Different consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Work ([[PoW]]), Proof-of-Stake ([[PoS]]), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ([[PBFT]]), have been developed to achieve this agreement efficiently and securely.
