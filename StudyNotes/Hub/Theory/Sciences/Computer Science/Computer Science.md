Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves the theory, design, development, and application of software and hardware components. Computer scientists work on various aspects such as algorithms, programming languages, data structures, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, databases, networking, and more. This field encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects, aiming to understand how computers work and to develop new technologies that can solve complex problems in various domains.

## Computer Science and AI/ML

Computer science, artificial intelligence ([[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI|AI]]), and machine learning ([[Machine Learning|ML]]) are closely interconnected fields.

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems, including their design, development, and application. It encompasses various subfields such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software engineering, and more. Computer scientists analyze problems and create solutions using computational techniques.

[[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI]] is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of simulating human-like intelligence. AI aims to develop systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, learn from experience, and make decisions accordingly. It involves subfields like natural language processing, computer vision, expert systems, robotics, and more.

[[Machine Learning|Machine learning]] is a subset of AI that deals with the development of algorithms and statistical models enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms allow systems to automatically improve their performance through experience or training. By analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns within it, ML enables machines to make predictions or take actions based on learned patterns.

The relationship between computer science and AI/ML is intertwined as computer science provides the foundational knowledge required for developing AI/ML technologies. Concepts from computer science such as data structures, algorithms, computational complexity theory are fundamental in building efficient AI/ML solutions.

Moreover, AI/ML techniques heavily rely on computational methods provided by computer science. Techniques like optimization algorithms for training neural networks or efficient data processing for handling large datasets require expertise in computer science principles.

In recent years especially, advancements in hardware technology have significantly contributed to the growth of AI/ML. The increase in computing power has empowered researchers to explore complex models and process large datasets efficiently.

## What is Computer Science's connection to Data Science?
