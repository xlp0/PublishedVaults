#XP 

[[Extreme Programming]] ([[Extreme Programming|XP]]) is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability. It aims to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. XP is known for its iterative and incremental approach, focusing on small releases and frequent feedback loops.

[[Kent Beck]] is widely regarded as the founder of Extreme Programming. He introduced the methodology in the late 1990s while working at Chrysler Corporation. Beck and his colleagues developed XP as a response to the challenges they faced in traditional software development processes. They sought to create a more efficient and effective way of delivering high-quality software.

The key principles of Extreme Programming include:

1. Communication: Emphasizes constant communication among team members, stakeholders, and customers to ensure shared understanding of goals, requirements, and progress.

2. Simplicity: Advocates for keeping things as simple as possible by avoiding unnecessary complexity, reducing waste, and focusing on what is essential for delivering value.

3. Feedback: Encourages frequent feedback loops through regular testing, continuous integration, and user involvement in order to quickly identify issues or changes needed.

4. Courage: Promotes taking risks, being open to change, and making necessary adjustments without fear of failure or criticism.

5. Respect: Values the contributions of all team members by fostering a collaborative environment that values diversity of ideas and encourages mutual respect.

6. Incremental Development: Supports iterative development with small releases that allow for continuous improvement based on customer feedback.

Extreme Programming also incorporates various practices such as test-driven development (TDD), pair programming (two programmers working together on the same code), continuous integration (integrating code changes frequently), refactoring (improving code without changing its external behavior), and others.

Overall, Extreme Programming provides an agile framework for developing software products efficiently while maintaining high quality standards through collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
