[[MPL|Motion Planning Language]] ([[MPL]]) is a language developed by [[Emilio Frazzoli]] that allows for expressing and specifying complex motion planning tasks in a concise and efficient manner. It is designed to assist in solving problems related to autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars or robots navigating through dynamic environments.

In Frazzoli's terms, [[MPL]] provides a way for engineers and researchers to describe the desired behavior of a system in terms of high-level objectives and constraints. It enables them to specify how the system should move, avoid obstacles, reach specific goals, or respond to changing conditions.

MPL is based on the idea of defining motion planning problems as [[optimization]] tasks. It provides a set of operators and constructs that allow users to define objectives (such as minimizing travel time or energy consumption) and constraints (such as avoiding collisions or staying within certain bounds).

The language allows for expressing complex motion planning problems by combining basic building blocks into more sophisticated constructs. These constructs include sequential composition, parallel composition, conditional execution, loops, and branching. By using these constructs effectively, users can create intricate plans that take into account various factors and contingencies.

One key aspect of MPL is its ability to reason about uncertainty and dynamics. It can handle situations where the environment or system parameters are uncertain or change over time. This enables autonomous systems to adapt their plans in real-time based on new information or changing conditions.

Overall, Motion Planning Language provides a powerful tool for specifying motion planning problems in an abstract and yet expressive way. It allows engineers and researchers to describe complex behaviors concisely while taking into account uncertainties and dynamic environments.
