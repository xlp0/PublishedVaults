Von Neumann Architecture is a computer architecture framework proposed by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann in the late 1940s. It is the basis for most modern computers and defines the architecture of a stored-program digital computer.

The key components of von Neumann Architecture include:

1. Central Processing Unit ([[CPU]]): This is the brain of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical operations, controls data flow, and executes instructions.

2. [[Memory]]: It stores both data and instructions required for program execution. In von Neumann Architecture, the memory is a single addressable space for storing both data and program instructions.

3. Control Unit: It manages the overall operation of the CPU by fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them.

4. Arithmetic Logic Unit ([[ALU]]): This component carries out mathematical calculations and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, etc.

5. Input/Output ([[I/O]]) devices: These devices allow communication between the computer and external devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, displays, etc.

The von Neumann Architecture follows a sequential execution model where instructions are fetched one at a time from memory into the CPU for execution. The next instruction to be executed is determined by the control unit based on program flow control statements like branches or jumps in a program.

One of the main advantages of von Neumann Architecture is its flexibility as it allows both data and program instructions to be stored in memory. However, it also has limitations such as the Von Neumann bottleneck which refers to the limited bandwidth between CPU and memory due to their shared bus.

Overall, von Neumann Architecture provides a foundational framework for designing efficient and versatile computers that are widely used today.
