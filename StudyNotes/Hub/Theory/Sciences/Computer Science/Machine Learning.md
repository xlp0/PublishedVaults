Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training a model on a large amount of [[Data|Data]], allowing it to identify patterns and make accurate predictions or decisions based on new or unseen data. Machine learning is used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Machine Learning is also a field that is closely linked with [[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI]]([[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI|AI]]).
