#BNF

[[Backus-Naur Form]] ([[Backus-Naur Form|BNF]]) is a notation technique used to formally describe the syntax of programming languages or other formal languages. It was developed by John Backus and Peter Naur in the 1960s as a way to define the syntax of ALGOL 60, one of the early programming languages.

BNF consists of a set of production rules that define how valid sentences or statements can be formed in a language. These rules are written in a combination of metasyntax notation and regular language constructs. The key elements used in BNF are:

1. Non-terminal symbols: These symbols represent syntactic categories or abstract entities in the language. They are typically represented by uppercase letters.

2. Terminal symbols: These symbols represent the basic building blocks or tokens in the language, such as keywords, operators, or literals. They are typically represented by lowercase letters or strings enclosed in quotes.

3. Production rules: These rules define how non-terminal symbols can be expanded into sequences of terminal and non-terminal symbols. They are written in the form "A ::= B C D," where A is a non-terminal symbol and B, C, D are either terminal or non-terminal symbols.

4. Meta-symbols: These symbols have special meanings within BNF notation, such as "::=" for defining production rules, "|" for alternative choices, "<>" for optional elements, and "[]" for repeated elements.

By using these elements, BNF provides a concise and formal way to specify the grammar of a language. It allows developers to define valid syntactic structures that conform to the rules defined by the grammar.

BNF has been widely adopted as a standard notation for describing programming language syntaxes and has influenced the development of other similar notations like Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), which includes additional features like repetition operators and grouping constructs.

Overall, Backus-Naur Form is an essential tool for defining the syntax of programming languages and other formal languages, enabling clear and precise communication about the structure of these languages.

# How is BNF related to lambda calculus?

BNF (Backus-Naur Form) and lambda calculus are both formal systems used to describe the syntax and semantics of programming languages.

BNF is a notation for specifying the grammar of a programming language. It consists of a set of production rules that define how valid expressions in the language can be formed. BNF is widely used in the field of compiler design and programming language theory.

[[Lambda calculus]], on the other hand, is a formal system developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. It provides a way to express computations using functions and variables without referring to any specific programming language syntax. Lambda calculus forms the foundation of functional programming languages and has influenced many modern programming languages such as Lisp, Haskell, and Python.

The connection between BNF and lambda calculus lies in their shared goal of providing a formal framework for describing programming languages. BNF is often used to define the syntax of a language, while lambda calculus provides a mathematical framework for defining the semantics (meaning) of programs. The concepts from lambda calculus, such as anonymous functions (lambdas) and variable substitution, can be used to define the operational semantics of a programming language.

In summary, BNF is a notation for specifying the grammar (syntax) of a programming language, while lambda calculus provides a mathematical framework for defining the semantics (meaning) of programs. Both BNF and lambda calculus are important tools in designing and analyzing programming languages.
