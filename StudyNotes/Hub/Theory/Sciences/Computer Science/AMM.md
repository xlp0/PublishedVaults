#AMM 

An [[AMM|Automated Market Maker]] ([[AMM]]) is a type of decentralized trading protocol that enables users to trade digital assets in a decentralized manner without the need for traditional order books or centralized intermediaries. It provides liquidity to the market by utilizing [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]] and algorithmic formulas to determine asset prices.

AMMs are commonly associated with [[DEX|decentralized exchanges]] ([[DEX|DEXs]]), which are platforms that facilitate peer-to-peer trading of digital assets. DEXs rely on AMMs to enable seamless and trustless trading by removing the need for buyers and sellers to find each other directly.

The relationship between AMMs and DEXs can be understood as follows: DEXs serve as the platforms where users can access AMMs, while AMMs provide the liquidity and pricing mechanisms needed for trades to occur on these platforms. AMMs ensure that there is always a pool of tokens available for trading, eliminating the need for buyers and sellers to match orders with each other.

Some well-known examples of AMMs include:

1. [[Uniswap]]: Uniswap is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges. It operates using an AMM model. It utilizes liquidity pools where users can deposit tokens, which are then used to facilitate trades based on an algorithmic pricing mechanism.

2. [[SushiSwap]]: SushiSwap is another prominent DEX built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It was forked from Uniswap but introduced additional features like yield farming and revenue-sharing with token holders.

3. [[Balancer]]: Balancer is an advanced AMM that allows users to create custom liquidity pools with multiple tokens and different weightings. This enables more complex trading strategies and portfolio management within a single pool.

4. [[Curve Finance]]: Curve Finance focuses on stablecoin trading by optimizing low-slippage trades between different stablecoin pairs. It aims to provide efficient swaps with lower fees compared to other AMMs.

These examples showcase the diversity in functionality and design choices among different AMMs, catering to various trading preferences and requirements.
