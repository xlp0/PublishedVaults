Manchester Autocode is a high-level programming language developed in the early 1950s at the University of Manchester, England. It was designed to be used with the Manchester Mark 1 computer, one of the earliest stored-program computers.

Autocode was created by a team led by [[Alick Glennie]], who wanted to make programming more accessible to non-experts. The language was developed based on the assembly language used for programming the Manchester Mark 1. Autocode aimed to simplify programming by introducing higher-level constructs and providing a more English-like syntax.

The development of Autocode can be traced back to earlier work on machine code interpretation and automatic coding at the university. However, it wasn't until 1952 that Autocode emerged as a distinct programming language.

Initially, Autocode had limited capabilities and served as an intermediary between machine code and assembly language. However, it quickly evolved into a more powerful language with features like arithmetic calculations, loops, conditionals, subroutines, and input/output operations.

Autocode gained popularity among researchers and programmers at the University of Manchester and other institutions using similar computers. It played a significant role in advancing early computer programming techniques and contributed to the development of subsequent high-level languages.

The success of Autocode led to further developments in programming languages at Manchester, including its successor Algol 60. Algol 60 went on to become an influential language in computer science education and research.

In summary, Manchester Autocode was an early high-level programming language developed at the University of Manchester in the 1950s. It aimed to simplify programming for non-experts and played a significant role in advancing early computer programming techniques.
