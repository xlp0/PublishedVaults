#metrics

A metric in operating system performance assessment is a quantitative measurement used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of an operating system. It helps assess various aspects of the system's performance, such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates. These metrics provide objective data that can be used to analyze and optimize the performance of an operating system. Common metrics in OS performance assessment include CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O rates, network latency, and system uptime.
