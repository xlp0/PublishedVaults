Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It treats computation as the evaluation of expressions, where functions are first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments, returned as results, and stored in data structures.

In functional programming languages, programs are built using pure functions, which have no side effects and always produce the same output for a given set of inputs. This eliminates many common sources of bugs and makes programs easier to reason about, test, and maintain.

One key characteristic of functional programming is immutability. Data is typically immutable, meaning it cannot be modified once created. Instead, new data structures are created with modified values. This promotes a more declarative style of programming, where you describe what you want the program to do rather than how to do it.

Functional programming languages also emphasize higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. Higher-order functions enable powerful abstractions and allow for concise and modular code.

Recursion is another important concept in functional programming. Instead of using iterative loops, recursion is used to define computations in terms of themselves. This allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be expressed recursively.

Some popular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp/Scheme, Erlang, Clojure, and Scala. One may also considere [[JavaScript]] being a [[Functional Programming Language|functional language]]. These languages provide strong support for functional programming techniques and often include advanced features like lazy evaluation and pattern matching.

Functional programming has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to handle complex problems with concise code and its suitability for parallel processing. It offers a different approach compared to imperative or object-oriented paradigms and provides unique benefits for certain types of applications.
