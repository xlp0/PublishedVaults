#W3C 
The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] ([[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Its goal is to provide a platform for collaboration and consensus among different stakeholders in order to maintain interoperability and accessibility of the Web.

[[URL]] ([[Uniform Resource Locator]]), [[URI]] ([[Uniform Resource Identifier]]), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]]), and [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] ([[Hypertext Markup Language]]) are all key components of the World Wide Web, and the W3C plays a significant role in their development, standardization, and maintenance.

URL: The W3C establishes guidelines and specifications for URLs, which are used to identify resources on the Web. It defines how URLs should be structured and how different components within a URL should be interpreted.

URI: The W3C also develops standards for URIs, which are a broader concept that encompasses both URLs and Uniform Resource Names (URNs). URIs provide a standard way to identify resources across different protocols and naming schemes.

HTTP: The W3C works on developing and maintaining the HTTP protocol, which is used for communication between clients (web browsers) and servers on the web. It sets standards for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, caching mechanisms, etc., ensuring interoperability between different web servers and clients.

HTML: HTML is the markup language used to structure content on the web. The W3C is responsible for defining specifications for HTML versions, such as HTML5. It ensures that HTML remains compatible with various web browsers and devices by establishing guidelines for its syntax, elements, attributes, etc.

Overall, the W3C plays an integral role in shaping the standards and technologies that form the foundation of the World Wide Web. Its work ensures cross-platform compatibility, accessibility, security, and innovation in areas like URL/URI structure, HTTP communication protocols, and HTML markup language.
