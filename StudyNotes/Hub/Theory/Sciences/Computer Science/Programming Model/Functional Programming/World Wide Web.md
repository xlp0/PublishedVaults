The [[World Wide Web]] ([[World Wide Web|WWW]]) is an information system that allows users to access and navigate through a vast collection of interconnected documents and resources. It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and became publicly available in 1991. The web uses the internet as its underlying network infrastructure, enabling the sharing and accessing of information globally.

The web consists of billions of web pages, which are written in [[Hypertext Markup Language]] ([[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]]) and can contain various types of media such as text, images, videos, and hyperlinks. These pages are hosted on servers around the world and can be accessed using web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

The key feature of the World Wide Web is its hyperlinking capability, allowing users to navigate between different web pages by clicking on hyperlinks or [[Universal Resource Locator|URLs]]. This interconnected nature of the web enables easy information retrieval, communication, collaboration, and e-commerce.

Additionally, the web has evolved to include various technologies like search engines, social media platforms, online shopping sites, streaming services, and more. It has transformed how we access information, communicate with others, conduct business transactions, entertain ourselves, and engage with the digital world as a whole.
