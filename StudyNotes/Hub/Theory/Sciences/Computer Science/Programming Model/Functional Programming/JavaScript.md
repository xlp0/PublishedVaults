[[JavaScript]] is a high-level programming language that is widely used in [[Computer Science|computer science]] and has become the de facto language for web development. It was initially developed as a client-side scripting language for web browsers, but its flexibility and versatility have led to its use in various other domains.

In computer science terms, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not require compilation before execution. This allows for dynamic and flexible development as changes can be made on-the-fly without the need for recompilation. It follows an event-driven programming paradigm, where code execution is triggered by specific events or user interactions.

JavaScript's primary application in the Web3 world lies in building decentralized applications ([[Literature/PKM/Tools/DataSecurity/dApp]]) on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. It enables developers to write smart contracts using languages like Solidity and interact with them through JavaScript-based front-end frameworks like React.js or Vue.js. This combination facilitates the creation of user-friendly and interactive interfaces for blockchain-based applications.

Moreover, JavaScript libraries such as Web3.js provide APIs for interacting with blockchain networks, allowing developers to read/write data from smart contracts, send/receive transactions, and perform other operations required for dApps. These libraries abstract away the complexities of interacting with the underlying blockchain protocols, making it easier for developers to build Web3 applications.

Additionally, JavaScript also plays a crucial role in other aspects of Web3 development such as decentralized identity systems ([[DID|DIDs]]), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, [[Non-Fungible Token|non-fungible tokens]] (NFTs), and more. Its versatility allows developers to create interactive user interfaces, handle complex logic, and connect with various backend services.

Overall, JavaScript's presence in the [[Web3]] world is pivotal due to its compatibility with web browsers and its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Its ability to combine front-end development with blockchain interactions makes it an essential tool for creating decentralized applications that enhance privacy, security, and transparency on the internet.

## Running in WebAssembly

[[JavaScript]] is a widely-used programming language for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser. JavaScript enables developers to manipulate [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] elements, handle user events, and communicate with servers. On the other hand, [[WebAssembly]] is a binary instruction format designed to be executed efficiently by modern web browsers. It allows developers to write high-performance code in languages like C++, Rust, or Go that can be run on the web. WebAssembly offers near-native performance and enables developers to create complex applications for the web.
