What is Hypertext Transfer Protocol in W3C terms

In W3C terms, [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]) refers to a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. HTTP allows clients (such as web browsers) to request resources from servers and receive responses containing the requested content. The W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium, is an international community dedicated to developing open standards for the web, including HTTP specifications.
