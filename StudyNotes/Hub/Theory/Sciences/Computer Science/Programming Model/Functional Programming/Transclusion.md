Transclusion is a concept in computer science and document processing that refers to the inclusion or embedding of a document or part of a document within another document. It allows content from one source to be dynamically included or referenced in multiple locations without needing to duplicate the content itself. Transclusion is commonly associated with hypertext systems, where it enables the creation of hyperlinks between different documents.

In the context of the [[World Wide Web]] ([[World Wide Web|WWW]]), transclusion is closely related to hyperlinks. Hyperlinks enable users to navigate between web pages or documents by simply clicking on a link. Transclusion takes this concept further by allowing portions of one document to be seamlessly integrated into another document, creating a connected and interlinked web of information.

The term "transclusion" was coined by [[Ted Nelson]], an American pioneer in information technology, in the early 1960s. Nelson is known for his work on hypertext systems and his vision for an interconnected global network called Xanadu. He envisioned a system where documents could be transcluded from various sources, enabling users to explore information in a non-linear and dynamic manner.

Although Ted Nelson's [[Project Xanadu|Xanadu project]] never fully materialized as originally envisioned, his ideas greatly influenced the development of hypertext systems and laid the foundation for concepts like transclusion and hyperlinking that are integral to the World Wide Web we know today. His contributions have had a lasting impact on information retrieval, digital publishing, and how we navigate and interact with online content.
