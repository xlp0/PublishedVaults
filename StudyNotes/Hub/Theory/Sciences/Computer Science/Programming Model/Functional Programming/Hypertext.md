Hypertext is a technology that allows users to navigate and access information in a non-linear way. It is a method of organizing and linking text, images, videos, and other media together to create a web of interconnected information.

The concept of hypertext was first proposed by [[Ted Nelson]] in the 1960s but gained popularity with the development of the World Wide Web in the 1990s. Hypertext is widely used on the internet, where it forms the basis of web pages and allows for easy navigation through hyperlinks.

In hypertext, information is organized into small chunks called nodes or pages. These nodes are connected through hyperlinks that allow users to jump from one node to another. Hyperlinks can be text-based or embedded within images or other media. By clicking on a hyperlink, users can instantly access related information or move to a different part of a document or website.

Hypertext is often associated with [[HTML]] (Hypertext Markup Language), which is used to create web pages on the internet. HTML provides tags and attributes that enable the creation of hyperlinks within documents. These hyperlinks can connect different web pages, websites, or even external resources.

The main advantage of hypertext is its non-linear structure. Unlike traditional linear texts like books, hypertext allows users to choose their own path through the information by following hyperlinks that interest them. This makes it easy to navigate and explore related topics or find additional details without having to read everything sequentially.

Hypertext also enables cross-referencing between different documents or sources. By linking relevant information together, users can easily access related content from various sources without needing to search extensively.

Overall, hypertext has revolutionized how we access and interact with information on the internet. It has made navigation more flexible and efficient while providing a seamless way to connect diverse sources of knowledge together.
