What is a Univeral Resource Locator in W3C terms?

In W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) terms, a [[Universal Resource Locator]] ([[Universal Resource Locator|URL]]) is a specific type of [[Universal Resource Identifier]] ([[Universal Resource Identifier|URI]]) that provides the address or location of a resource on the internet. It is a standardized way to specify the address of a web page, file, or any other resource available on the web. A URL typically consists of several components including the protocol (e.g., http, https), the domain name, and optional path and query parameters.
