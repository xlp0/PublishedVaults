[[HTML]] ([[HTML|Hypertext Markup Language]]) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. It provides a structure and format for organizing the content on the internet. HTML uses a set of tags to define the elements within a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more. It is always mentioned as a container or markup language for [[Hyperlink|hyperlinks]].

Here are some key points about HTML:

1. Structure: HTML provides a hierarchical structure to organize content on a webpage. It uses elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` to define the overall structure of a page.

2. Tags: HTML tags are used to mark up different parts of a webpage's content. They are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`). For example, `<h1>` tag is used to define a heading, `<p>` tag for paragraphs, and `<img>` tag for images.

3. Attributes: HTML tags can contain attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior. Attributes are placed inside the opening tag and consist of a name and value. For example, the `src` attribute in an `<img>` tag specifies the image source.

4. Hyperlinks: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` (anchor) tag. By specifying the destination URL within the `href` attribute of an anchor tag, users can click on it to navigate to another page or location within the same page.

5. Multimedia: HTML supports embedding various multimedia elements like images (`<img>`), audio (`<audio>`), video (`<video>`), and more into web pages.

6. Forms: HTML provides form elements like text fields (`<input type="text">`), checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`), radio buttons (`<input type="radio">`), dropdown lists (`<select>`), etc., allowing users to interact with web content by submitting data.

7. Semantics: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc., which provide more meaningful structure and improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

8. CSS Integration: HTML is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the presentation and styling of web pages. CSS allows you to define fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual aspects of HTML elements.

Overall, HTML serves as the backbone of the web by defining the structure and content of web pages. It is supported by all modern web browsers and works seamlessly with other technologies
