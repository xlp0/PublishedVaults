Double entry bookkeeping ([[Double Entry Bookkeeping|DEB]]) is a method of recording financial transactions that ensures accuracy and completeness in a company's financial records. It is based on the concept that every transaction has two aspects: a debit and a credit. For every debit entry made, there must be an equal and corresponding credit entry.

The double entry system follows the accounting equation, which states that assets equal liabilities plus equity. This equation must always be in balance after each transaction is recorded. The system uses T-accounts to record these entries, with debits on the left side and credits on the right side.

In double entry bookkeeping, each transaction affects at least two accounts. For example, when a company sells goods for cash, it would debit the cash account (increasing assets) and credit the sales account (increasing revenue). This ensures that both sides of the equation remain balanced.

The advantages of double entry bookkeeping include:

1. Accuracy: By recording both debits and credits for each transaction, errors can be easily identified and corrected.
2. Completeness: Double entry ensures that all transactions are recorded, preventing any omission or misrepresentation of financial information.
3. Financial analysis: The system provides detailed records that can be used for analysis, such as preparing financial statements or calculating ratios.
4. Auditability: Double entry bookkeeping makes it easier for auditors to review and verify financial records.

Overall, double entry bookkeeping serves as a foundational principle in modern accounting systems by providing a systematic way to record financial transactions accurately and maintain the integrity of financial information within an organization.

# Arthur Cayley on DEB

[[Arthur Cayley]] was a renowned mathematician in the 19th century and wrote a [[@cayleyPrinciplesBookkeepingDouble1894|booklet]] on double entry bookkeeping. However, double entry bookkeeping is a system of accounting that has been used for centuries. It was first documented by Italian mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]] in his book "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" published in 1494. This book included detailed explanations of the double entry method and its benefits in recording financial transactions accurately.

The connection bewteen Arthur Cayley's work on [[Double Entry Bookkeeping]] is further explained in this paper: [[@PDFQuantumInformation|Quantum Information and Accounting Information]]. More over, it should be noted that Arthur Cayley being one of the progenitors of [[Group theory]], the following statement by [[David P. Ellerman]] is even stronger:

# Augustus De Morgan and William Hamilton on DEB
The famous logician, [[Augustus De Morgan]] also wrote a book [[@morganElementsArithmetic2022|Elements of Arithmetic]] which repeated mentioned [[Double Entry Bookkeeping]]. It also relates to the notion of [[Conjugate functions]] or [[Algebraic Couples]] as articulated by [[William Hamilton|William Rowan Hamilton]] in [[@hamiltonTHEORYCONJUGATEFUNCTIONS|The Theory of Conjugate Functions]]/ or the "Preliminary and Elementary Essay" on [[Algebra as the Science of Pure Time]], the sentiment of having paired and some what causally balanced data structure is a crucial mechanism to make reasoning work.

David Ellerman also linked [[T-accounts]] to [[William Hamilton]]:

## A Pedagogical Framing for DEB
In [[GASing]] method, the way to relate physical concepts with numbers and paired or group action of pre-arithmetic students provides a process to help people become acquaint with numbers and quantities. This process is in fact richer than just [[Double Entry Bookkeeping]] but conceptually related. It also shows that [[arithemtic]] and [[Algebra|algebraic]] concepts should be taught with social and physical settings that relates to direct human experience at all temporal and spatial scales.
