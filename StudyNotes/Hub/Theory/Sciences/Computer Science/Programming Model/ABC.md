ABC is a high-level programming language that was developed in the late 1970s at [[CWI|Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica]] ([[CWI]]) in the Netherlands. It was designed to be a simple and easy-to-learn language aimed at non-programmers, with a focus on readability and expressiveness.

ABC introduced several innovative features that were later incorporated into other programming languages, including Python. Some of these features include:

1. Indentation-based syntax: ABC used indentation to denote blocks of code, similar to Python's use of whitespace. This approach made the code more readable and eliminated the need for explicit block delimiters.

2. Built-in data types: ABC had built-in support for various data types such as strings, lists, and dictionaries. These data structures made it easier to work with complex data in an intuitive manner.

3. Automatic memory management: ABC introduced automatic garbage collection, relieving programmers from manual memory management tasks.

4. Object-oriented programming: While not as fully-fledged as in modern languages like Python, ABC had support for object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance.

Despite its innovative design principles and simplicity, ABC did not gain widespread popularity or adoption outside of academia. However, it heavily influenced the development of Python.

[[Python]]'s creator [[Guido van Rossum]] was involved in the design and implementation of ABC during his time at CWI. When he later developed Python in the late 1980s, he drew inspiration from ABC's syntax and philosophy while expanding upon it with additional features.

Python inherited many concepts from ABC, including its indentation-based syntax, clean and readable code style, and emphasis on simplicity and ease-of-use. This makes Python feel familiar to those who have worked with ABC or languages influenced by it.

In summary, ABC was a precursor to Python that introduced several key ideas that are now widely used in modern programming languages. Its focus on simplicity and readability laid the foundation for Python's success as a programming language.
