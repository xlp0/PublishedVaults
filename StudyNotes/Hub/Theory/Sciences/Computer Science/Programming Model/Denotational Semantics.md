Denotational semantics is an approach to formalizing the meaning of programming languages or other formal systems. It aims to provide a mathematical model for understanding the behavior of programs by mapping them to mathematical objects, usually called denotations or domains.

The fundamental idea behind denotational semantics is that the meaning of a program can be determined by its effect on some mathematical structure. This structure, known as a domain, represents the possible values and behaviors that a program can exhibit. The denotation of a program is then defined as a function from its input domain to its output domain, capturing the transformation it performs.

Denotational semantics provides a precise and abstract way to reason about programs and their behavior. It allows for rigorous analysis of program properties such as termination, correctness, and equivalence. By defining the meaning of programming constructs in terms of underlying mathematical structures, denotational semantics also facilitates the development of formal reasoning techniques and tools.

Overall, denotational semantics offers a systematic approach to understanding and reasoning about programming languages, providing insights into their behavior and enabling the development of reliable software systems.
