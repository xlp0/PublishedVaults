This phrase came from [[William Hamilton]]'s article titled: [[@hamiltonTHEORYCONJUGATEFUNCTIONS|THEORY OF CONJUGATE FUNCTIONS, OR ALGEBRAIC COUPLES; WITH A PRELIMINARY AND ELEMENTARY ESSAY ON ALGEBRA AS THE SCIENCE OF PURE TIME]].

The length of this title encoded some powerful insights about the science of [[Time|causation]]. Since [[William Hamilton|Hamilton]] clearly thought of [[Algebraic Couples]] or [[Conjugate functions]] being a way to scientifically reason about relations over time. The title of this article also directly demonstrated that he is well aware of the impact of [[Double Entry Bookkeeping]] being a mechanism for logically (as in [[Logos]]) and functionally denote (write it down on a double entry book) the cause and effects of payments and receptions as a set of conjugate actions.

## Representing all physically-related data as Events
In the [[Theory of Relativity]], all physically-related data are all represented as [[Events]]. This idea has been articularly and formulated by physicists extensively. For more details, see [[@dialectSpacetimeMetric2022#How to define an event|event defined]].
