Data backup refers to the process of creating a copy or copies of data in order to safeguard against data loss, corruption, accidental deletion, or any other unforeseen events. It is an essential part of data management and is crucial for businesses and individuals alike.

# What is the 3-2-1 back up rule?

The 3-2-1 backup rule is a best practice guideline for data backup and recovery. It suggests having at least three copies of your data, stored on two different types of media, with one copy stored off-site or in the cloud.

1. Three copies: This means having three separate copies of your data. The original file counts as one copy, and then you should create two additional copies to ensure redundancy.

2. Two different types of media: Storing your data on two different types of media (e.g., hard drives, tapes, cloud storage) reduces the risk of losing all copies due to a single type of failure or disaster. For example, if one copy is stored on a hard drive and another on a cloud server, you are protected against physical damage to the hard drive or issues with the cloud server.

3. One off-site or cloud storage: Keeping at least one copy off-site (outside of your primary location) provides protection against disasters like fire, theft, or natural disasters that may affect all copies stored in a single location. Cloud storage can be an effective way to store an off-site copy since it ensures remote accessibility and often includes built-in redundancy measures. 

By following the 3-2-1 backup rule, you minimize the risk of losing your data due to hardware failures, human errors, malware attacks, or other unforeseen events. This directly relates to the [[Physical Meaning of Data]].****
