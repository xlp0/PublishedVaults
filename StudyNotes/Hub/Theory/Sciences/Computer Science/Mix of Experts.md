#MoE 

[[Mix of Experts]] (MoE) is a machine learning architecture that combines multiple specialized models (experts) to solve a complex task. Each expert is designed to perform well on a specific subset of the input data or certain aspects of the problem. The model then learns to dynamically select which expert to use for each input, typically based on the input's characteristics or some gating mechanism. The combination of these experts allows the MoE model to handle diverse inputs and achieve better performance overall.

Here's a general outline of how a Mix of Experts model works:

1. Expert Selection: The MoE model first takes in the input data and uses a gating mechanism to determine which expert(s) should handle the input. The gating mechanism can be based on probabilities, learned weights, or any other rule that decides the contribution of each expert.

2. Expert Execution: Once the gating mechanism selects the appropriate experts, each expert processes the input independently. Experts can be specialized models or even simple functions designed to handle specific input patterns or features.

3. Expert Output: Each expert produces its output or prediction based on the input it received.

4. Expert Combination: The outputs from all the selected experts are combined using a weighted sum or other fusion methods, and the final prediction or output of the MoE model is determined.

MoE models have been applied to various tasks in machine learning, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. However, applying MoE concepts to large-scale language models like GPT may involve significant architectural modifications, and I am not aware of any specific implementation of a "Mix of Experts" model in GPT up until my last update in September 2021.

Since research and model advancements are continuously evolving, there might have been new developments after my last update. I recommend checking the latest literature and research papers for any updates or specific information about Mix of Experts models in the context of language models like GPT.
