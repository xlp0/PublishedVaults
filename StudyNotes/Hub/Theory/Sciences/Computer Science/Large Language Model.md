A [[Large Language Model|large language model]], such as GPT-3.5, is a powerful [[Hub/Theory/Sciences/Computer Science/AI|artificial intelligence]] system designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models are built using deep learning techniques, particularly transformers, which enable them to capture and learn complex patterns in language data. A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models are built using deep learning techniques and are trained on vast amounts of text data from various sources such as books, articles, and websites.

Large language models have the ability to process and understand natural language, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. They can be used for a wide range of applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, translation services, sentiment analysis, and more.

The size of a large language model refers to the number of parameters it has. Models with billions of parameters are increasingly common in recent years. Examples of prominent large language models include OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and Facebook's RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT approach). These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.

## Compositionality at the Linguistic Level

The [[Compositionality|compositionality]] of data refers to the ability to understand and generate meaningful combinations of smaller linguistic units to form larger, more complex expressions. Language models play a crucial role in understanding and leveraging compositionality in data. They learn to associate individual words or tokens with their semantic meaning, and they also learn to recognize and generate coherent combinations of words that form meaningful phrases, sentences, and even longer text passages.

For example, if a language model is trained on a large corpus of text that includes the phrase "The cat sat on the mat," it learns that "cat," "sat," "on," and "mat" can be combined to create a coherent sentence. It then generalizes this knowledge to generate similar sentences when prompted with related inputs.

By capturing the statistical regularities in language data, large language models excel at understanding and generating compositions of words, phrases, and sentences. They can go beyond simple word associations and grasp the syntactic and semantic relationships between different linguistic units. This enables them to compose text that is coherent and contextually appropriate.

The compositionality of data is vital in various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and dialogue systems. Language models help in these tasks by effectively capturing the compositional structure of language, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.
## Advancement in Compositionality and in LLM
The creation of tools such as [[Langchain]] is a critical step in streamlining the emergence of data assets through the composition of data processing workflows. When [[Langchain]] is integrated with [[Zettlekasten Workflow]]/[[Intentional Workflow|intentional workflow]] and supported by a fluid frontend tool such [[Obsidian]], a new level of productivity could [[Emergence|emerge]].
