According to [[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra|Dijkstra]], a [[Computer Program|computer program]] can be defined as a precise and unambiguous description of the steps to be followed by a computer in order to solve a specific problem. Dijkstra emphasized that a computer program should not only be correct but also provably correct, meaning that its [[Correctness|correctness]] can be [[Mathematical Proof|mathematically proven]].

In Dijkstra's terms, a computer program is seen as a formal composition of commands or instructions that are executed sequentially. These commands are written in a programming language and represent the actions or operations to be performed by the computer. The program is designed to manipulate data and transform it according to the specified algorithm.

Dijkstra emphasized the importance of clarity and simplicity in writing programs. He advocated for structured programming, which involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts using control structures such as loops and conditionals. This approach aims to improve program readability, maintainability, and understandability.

Furthermore, Dijkstra stressed the need for rigorous verification and proof techniques in software development. He believed that programs should not only work correctly on sample inputs but also exhibit correctness under all possible inputs and conditions. By applying mathematical reasoning and formal methods, programmers can strive for the highest level of assurance in their programs.

Overall, in Dijkstra's view, a computer program is not just a set of instructions for a machine; it is an intellectual artifact that requires careful design, precision, and mathematical rigor to ensure its correctness and reliability.
