When people talking about x86 in computer industry, what are they talking about, and what are other counter part products, please give me a history of this term, and companies that makes x86 products

When people talk about x86 in the computer industry, they are typically referring to a family of instruction set architectures (ISAs) that are based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor. The term "x86" is often used to describe a particular type of Central Processing Unit ([[CPU]]) architecture that is widely used in personal computers and servers.

The history of x86 dates back to the late 1970s when Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor. This 16-bit CPU became the foundation for subsequent generations of processors, including the 80286, 80386, and so on. Over time, these processors evolved into 32-bit (e.g., Intel Pentium) and later 64-bit (e.g., Intel Core i7) architectures.

While Intel is considered the originator and primary manufacturer of x86 processors, other notable companies have also developed compatible processors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one such company that has been producing x86 CPUs since the early 1990s. AMD's processors are largely compatible with Intel's and offer alternative options for consumers.

The terms "x86" or "x86 architecture" are often used interchangeably with "IA-32" or "IA-64", which stand for Intel Architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit addressing modes, respectively. These terms refer to different generations or extensions of the x86 architecture.

In recent years, several other companies have entered the x86 market as well. These include VIA Technologies with their VIA C3 and VIA Nano processors, as well as Transmeta Corporation which produced low-power x86-compatible CPUs.

Overall, x86 processors have dominated the personal computer market for several decades due to their compatibility with a vast range of software applications and operating systems. They remain widely used today in desktops, laptops, servers, and other computing devices.
