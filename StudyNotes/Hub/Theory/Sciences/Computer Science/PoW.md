Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm used in [[Blockchain|blockchain]] networks to validate and confirm transactions. It was first introduced as a solution to the double-spending problem in [[Bitcoin]], but has since been adopted by various other cryptocurrencies.

In a PoW system, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. The puzzles are designed to be difficult to solve but easy to verify once solved. Miners use computational power and energy resources to make multiple attempts at solving the puzzle, and the first miner to find a solution broadcasts it to the network.

The solution, also known as a "proof," is added along with the new block of transactions to the blockchain. Other participants in the network can easily verify that the proof is correct by applying it to the puzzle. Once verified, the block is considered valid, and all its transactions are confirmed.

The process of finding a valid proof requires significant computational power and energy consumption, making it economically costly for miners. This cost serves as a deterrent against malicious activities like spamming or altering previous blocks. It also ensures that no single entity or group can monopolize control over the blockchain network.

Furthermore, PoW ensures decentralization by allowing anyone with adequate computing resources to participate in mining and block validation. However, PoW systems suffer from scalability issues due to their resource-intensive nature and high transaction confirmation times.

Despite its limitations, PoW remains widely used because of its security guarantees and proven track record in securing blockchain networks like Bitcoin. However, alternative consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) have emerged as they offer reduced energy consumption and faster transaction speed while still maintaining security.
