When Dijkstra speaks of "[[Radical Novelty]]," he is referring to the concept of creating entirely new and innovative solutions or approaches to problems. He emphasizes the importance of thinking outside the box and avoiding being limited by existing conventions or traditional methods. According to [[Edsger Wybe Dijkstra|Dijkstra]], true progress can only be achieved by embracing radical novelty and constantly seeking new ways to tackle challenges. This term was mentioned many times in his paper named: "[[@dijkstraCrueltyReallyTeaching2022|On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science]]".
