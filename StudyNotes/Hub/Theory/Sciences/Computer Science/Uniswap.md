The Uniswap protocol is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries, such as traditional exchanges or order books.

Uniswap operates on an [[AMM|automated market maker]] ([[AMM)]] model, which means it uses smart contracts to create liquidity pools. These pools are filled with funds from users who provide liquidity by depositing tokens into them. In return, liquidity providers receive a share of the trading fees generated by the protocol.

The key feature of Uniswap is its use of a constant product market-making formula known as the "x*y=k" equation. This equation ensures that the product of the token balances in a liquidity pool remains constant, which determines the price at which trades are executed.

Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams in November 2018 and gained significant popularity due to its simple and user-friendly interface. It has become one of the most widely used decentralized exchanges in the cryptocurrency space.

There are no specific agencies or persons directly associated with Uniswap as it is a decentralized protocol. However, there is a team behind its development called Uniswap Labs, which focuses on improving and maintaining the protocol's codebase. Additionally, there is also a community of developers and users who contribute to its growth and adoption.

It's important to note that while Uniswap Labs maintains some control over the development of Uniswap, it does not have control over individual pools or user funds. The protocol's decentralized nature ensures that trades and transactions occur directly between users' wallets without any central authority or intermediary involvement.
