In abstract interpretation, [[Soundness|soundness]] refers to the property of an analysis that ensures the results produced by the analysis are guaranteed to be [[Correctness|correct]] or conservative with respect to the actual program semantics. Soundness is a fundamental property that ensures the reliability and trustworthiness of the analysis results. [[Sound and Complete|Soundness and Completeness]] are often mentioned together (see [[Completeness|completeness]]).

More specifically, soundness means that the analysis does not produce any false positives. In other words, if the analysis determines that a certain property holds for a program, then it is guaranteed to actually hold in the concrete execution of the program.

To achieve soundness, an abstract interpretation analysis must adhere to two key principles:

1. Abstraction: The analysis uses an abstract domain to represent program states and behaviors in a simplified and abstracted manner. The abstraction captures the relevant aspects of the concrete program semantics while omitting unnecessary details. The abstract domain should be designed such that it over-approximates the set of possible concrete program behaviors. This over-approximation ensures that any property inferred in the abstract domain will also hold in the concrete execution.
    
2. Soundness of Operations: The analysis employs various operations, such as join, meet, transfer functions, widening, and narrowing, to manipulate the abstract values and propagate information. These operations must be defined in a sound manner, meaning they should maintain the relationship between the concrete and abstract domains. The operations should ensure that any property inferred or computed on the abstract values is a sound approximation of the corresponding property on the concrete values.
    

By ensuring both the abstraction and soundness of operations, an abstract interpretation analysis guarantees that the results obtained are conservative and correct. This allows for making reliable statements about the program's properties, such as [[Safety|safety]], [[Termination|termination]], or [[Correctness|correctness]], within the limitations and abstractions of the chosen abstract domain.

Soundness is a crucial property in abstract interpretation as it provides confidence in the analysis results and forms the basis for reasoning about program properties.
