John Ousterhout is a prominent computer scientist and software engineer. He was born on October 15, 1954, in Seattle, Washington. Ousterhout has made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of operating systems and programming languages.

He earned his Bachelor's degree in Physics from Yale University in 1975 and went on to complete his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980. After completing his education, Ousterhout joined Stanford University as a faculty member, where he taught and conducted research for many years.

One of Ousterhout's most significant contributions is the creation of the Tcl scripting language (Tool Command Language) in 1988. Tcl became widely used for developing rapid prototyping tools and was instrumental in the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Ousterhout also developed Tk, a toolkit that provides a set of GUI building blocks for Tcl.

In addition to Tcl/Tk, Ousterhout has worked on various other projects throughout his career. He developed the Sprite operating system, which introduced the concept of lightweight threads called "threads are cheap" and influenced subsequent operating system designs. He also co-developed the [[Raft]] protocol with [[Diego Ongaro]].

Ousterhout has also been involved with several startup companies. Notably, he co-founded Electric Cloud Inc., which focuses on providing software development solutions for optimizing build and test processes.

Aside from his academic and entrepreneurial endeavors, John Ousterhout is well-known for his book "A Philosophy of Software Design," published in 2018. The book offers valuable insights into designing simple yet effective software systems.

Throughout his career, John Ousterhout has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to computer science. He became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1994 and received the ACM Software System Award in 1997 for Tcl/Tk.

Overall, John Ousterhout is a highly respected figure in the field of computer science, known for his influential work on scripting languages, operating systems, and software design principles.
