#CbC #Correctness

[[Correct by Construction|Correctness by Construction]] (CbC) is a software development approach that focuses on ensuring the [[Correctness|correctness]] of software systems from the very beginning of the development process. It emphasizes the principle that it is easier and more cost-effective to prevent errors than to fix them later in the development lifecycle.

In CbC, developers aim to build software systems that are provably correct through a combination of formal methods, rigorous analysis, and [[Mathematical proof|mathematical proofs]]. The goal is to eliminate as many bugs and vulnerabilities as possible before deploying the system.

The CbC approach typically involves several key steps:

1. Specification: Developers start by creating a precise and unambiguous specification of what the software system should do. This specification serves as a contract between the developers and stakeholders, providing clear expectations for system behavior.

2. Design: Based on the specification, developers design the system architecture and its components using formal notations or modeling languages. This step ensures that all aspects of the system are well-defined and can be reasoned about mathematically.

3. Verification: Formal verification techniques are applied to ensure that the design meets the specified requirements. These techniques include model checking, theorem proving, symbolic execution, and static analysis. By using these methods, developers can mathematically prove that their design adheres to desired properties such as safety, liveness, and security.

4. Implementation: Once the design is verified, developers proceed with implementing the system based on this formally verified design. The implementation follows strict coding standards and guidelines to minimize errors during this phase.

5. Testing: While testing is still an important component in CbC, it plays a complementary role rather than being solely relied upon for ensuring correctness. Testing focuses on validating specific functional aspects of the system but cannot guarantee full correctness.

6. Maintenance: After deployment, CbC systems require ongoing maintenance to address any potential bugs or issues discovered during real-world usage. However, since CbC systems are designed with correctness in mind, they tend to have fewer critical issues and are easier to maintain than traditional software systems.

While Correctness by Construction can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, it offers significant benefits. By prioritizing correctness from the beginning, CbC reduces the risk of system failures, security breaches, and costly rework. It also promotes a more disciplined software development process by employing formal methods and rigorous analysis techniques.
