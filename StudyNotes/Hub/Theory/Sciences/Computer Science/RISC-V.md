RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for designing computer processors. It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010, and since then it has gained significant attention and adoption in both academia and industry.

The main features of RISC-V include:

1. Simplicity: RISC-V follows a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) approach, which means it has a relatively small number of simple instructions. This simplicity aids in easier implementation, better code density, and efficient execution.

2. Modularity: The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for customization and specialization based on specific requirements. It provides optional extensions for additional functionalities, such as floating-point operations or vector processing.

3. Scalability: RISC-V supports various configurations from tiny embedded systems to powerful servers. It offers different base instruction set variants (32-bit, 64-bit) and can be extended to support wider word sizes or more complex operations.

4. Openness: One of the key aspects of RISC-V is its open-source nature. Anyone can access the specifications, design their own compatible processors or tools, contribute to the development process, and use it without any licensing fees.

Competitors of RISC-V include other established ISAs such as [[ARM]] (Advanced RISC Machines), x86 ([[Intel]]/[[AMD]]), MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages), Power Architecture (IBM), and SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture).

Several companies and organizations are involved in producing processors based on RISC-V. Some notable producers include SiFive, Western Digital (for storage controllers), Nvidia (for AI accelerators), Andes Technology, Microchip Technology (formerly MIPS Technologies), and Esperanto Technologies.

It's worth noting that many companies also adopt RISC-V internally for custom processor designs tailored to their specific needs without necessarily becoming commercial producers themselves.
