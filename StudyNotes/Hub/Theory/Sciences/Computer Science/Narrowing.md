#under_approximate #abstract_interpretation #precision #fixpoint 

In [[Abstract Interpretation|abstract interpretation]], narrowing is a technique used to refine the abstraction and regain precision after applying [[Widening|widening]]. It is applied when the widening operator introduces imprecision and the analysis requires a more precise result.

After applying widening, the analysis may produce an over-approximation of the program's behavior that is too imprecise for the desired analysis goals. In such cases, narrowing is used to iteratively refine the abstraction and obtain a more precise result.

The narrowing operator takes two abstract values as input, typically the current abstract value and the value from the previous iteration. It computes a new abstract value that is a refined approximation, narrowing down the imprecision introduced by the widening operator.

The narrowing operator works by gradually reducing the imprecision in the abstract value. It tries to refine the abstraction to make it more consistent with the concrete behaviors of the program. This is done by selectively tightening the approximation and updating the abstract value based on additional information obtained during the analysis.

Unlike widening, narrowing is typically more expensive in terms of computational cost. It often involves exploring additional information, performing extra computations, or even solving constraints to refine the abstraction. Therefore, narrowing is usually applied sparingly and only when necessary to improve precision.

The choice of the narrowing operator depends on the abstract domain used in the analysis. It should aim to strike a balance between precision and efficiency, ensuring that the refinement process converges to a fixpoint without introducing excessive computational overhead.

It's important to note that narrowing is an optional technique in abstract interpretation. Some analyses may not employ narrowing if the precision obtained from the widening operator is sufficient for the desired analysis goals. The decision to use narrowing depends on the specific analysis requirements, the properties being analyzed, and the trade-off between precision and efficiency.

## Issues with Under Approximation
In traditional abstract interpretation, narrowing is not commonly used as a standard operator. Instead, narrowing is used in certain specialized contexts or variations of abstract interpretation.

The primary reason narrowing is not commonly employed is that it can undermine the [[Soundness|soundness]] of the analysis. The widening operator, which introduces imprecision, is generally considered a safe over-approximation that guarantees termination and soundness of the analysis. On the other hand, narrowing can lead to an under-approximation, potentially violating soundness by excluding valid program behaviors.

While narrowing is conceptually possible, it is challenging to define a general and sound narrowing operator that refines the abstract value without introducing unsoundness. Unlike widening, which is a [[Safety|safe]] and conservative operation, narrowing needs to make assumptions or make precise choices about the program's behavior, which can be challenging due to the inherent imprecision of abstract interpretation.

That being said, in specific cases or specialized variants of abstract interpretation, narrowing can be used cautiously and with additional considerations. These variants may involve domain-specific narrowing operators tailored for specific abstract domains or carefully designed narrowing strategies that guarantee soundness. However, such narrowing operators are not commonly used in the general context of abstract interpretation.

To summarize, while narrowing is not commonly used as a standard operator in traditional abstract interpretation due to the challenges it poses for soundness, there may be specialized contexts or variants where narrowing is employed cautiously with domain-specific operators or strategies.

In summary, narrowing is a technique used in abstract interpretation to refine the abstraction and regain precision after applying widening. It reduces imprecision introduced by widening by iteratively tightening the abstraction. While narrowing can improve precision, it comes with additional computational cost and is applied selectively when necessary to achieve the desired analysis goals.
