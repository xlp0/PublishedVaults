[[Granularity]] refers to the level of detail or specificity in a particular context. It is a concept that is used in various fields such as data analysis, computer science, and information theory.

In data analysis, granularity refers to the size or scale at which data is collected or analyzed. A higher level of granularity means that data is collected and analyzed at a more detailed level, whereas a lower level of granularity means that data is collected and analyzed at a broader level. For example, in sales data analysis, the granularity can be at the individual transaction level or aggregated at a monthly sales total.

In computer science, granularity refers to the extent to which a system can be broken down into smaller components or tasks. A high level of granularity means that the system is divided into smaller and more specific modules or functions, while a low level of granularity means that the system consists of larger and more general components. The choice of granularity can affect factors such as performance, maintainability, and reusability of the system.

In information theory, granularity refers to the amount of information contained in a message or signal. A higher level of granularity means that the message contains more detailed and specific information, while a lower level of granularity means that the message contains broader and less specific information.

Overall, granularity is an important concept as it allows for different levels of analysis, decomposition, and understanding depending on the context and requirements. The appropriate choice of granularity can impact how effectively information is processed, systems are designed, or insights are derived from data.

## How to measure granularity
The notion of granularity in cognitive processes and decision-making in general can be related to the [[The Four Key Metrics|Four Key Metrics]] in [[DevSecOps|DevOps]]. The first three metrics in the Four Key Metrics are [[Time|time-related]], and the last one is basically the rate of being [[Correctness|correct]]. Therefore, the granularity of decision-making can be grounded in these four key metrics in terms of temporal granularity, and filter the metrics in terms of error rates, the negation of being [[Correctness|correct]]. This provides
