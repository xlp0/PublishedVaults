1. Dynamics: Refers to the loudness or softness of a musical passage, indicated by terms such as [[pianissimo]] (pp), [[piano]] (p), [[mezzo piano]] (mp), [[mezzo forte]] (mf), [[forte]] (f), [[fortissimo]] (ff), and more.

2. Tempo: Indicates the speed or pace of a musical piece, represented by terms like [[adagio]] (slow), [[andante]] (moderate walking pace), [[allegro]] (fast and lively), [[presto]] (very fast), etc.

3. Articulation: Describes how individual notes are played or sung, including [[staccato]] (short and detached), [[legato]] (smooth and connected), accentuated notes, and more.

4. Key signatures: Represent the tonality of a piece by indicating which notes are [[sharp]] (#) or [[flat]] (b) throughout the composition.

5. Time signatures: Indicate the number of beats in each measure and what type of note receives one beat, such as 4/4 time, 3/4 time, 6/8 time, etc.

6. Musical ornaments: Decorative embellishments added to a melody, including trills, turns, mordents, grace notes, etc., which add expressive elements to the music.

7. Repeat signs: Indicate when a section of music should be played again, typically marked with double barlines with two dots on either side.

8. [[Fermata]]: Indicates that a note or rest should be held longer than its normal duration.

9. Slurs and ties: Slurs indicate smooth and connected playing between different notes while ties connect two identical pitches indicating that they should be played as one sustained note.

10. Dynamics markings: Specific symbols used within notation to indicate gradual volume changes throughout a piece such as [[crescendo]] (∆) for gradually getting louder or [[decrescendo]] (∇) for gradually getting softer.

These are just a few examples of the many terms used in musical notation to indicate various musical strengths and instructions.
