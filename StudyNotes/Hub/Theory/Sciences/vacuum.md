In a physical sense, vacuum refers to a space or region that is devoid of matter, particularly gas, liquid, or solid particles. It is a state of emptiness where the pressure is significantly lower than atmospheric pressure. In a vacuum, the absence of particles allows for the absence of physical interactions such as collisions and conduction of heat or electricity. Vacuums can occur naturally in outer space or can be artificially created in laboratory settings using various techniques.
