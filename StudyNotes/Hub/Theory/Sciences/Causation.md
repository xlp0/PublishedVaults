## Speed of Causation

The [[light speed|speed of light]] is related to the [[Electric permittivity|electric permittivity]] of free space ($\epsilon_0$) and [[Magnetic permeability|magnetic permeability]] of free space ($\mu_0$). The relationship between these three quantities is given by the equation: 
$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}$$

This relationship is derived from [[Maxwell’s equations]], which describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves. As [[ChatGPT]] would say: 
The speed of causation is not defined as the quotient of permeability and permittivity.

Permittivity and permeability are properties of a medium that describe its response to electric and magnetic fields, respectively. Permittivity (ε) is a measure of how easily electric fields can propagate through a material, while permeability (μ) relates to the ease with which magnetic fields can propagate. These properties are relevant in the context of electromagnetic waves, such as light, which can travel at a certain speed in a given medium depending on the values of permittivity and permeability.

However, the speed of causation, as commonly understood, refers to the speed at which cause and effect propagate or influence each other in the universe. It pertains to how quickly information or influence can travel from one point to another and is not directly related to permittivity or permeability.

In most physical theories, including classical physics and the [[Theory of Relativity|theory of relativity]], the speed of causation is considered to be equal to the speed of light in a vacuum, denoted by the symbol "c." According to the theory of relativity, this speed sets an upper limit on the transmission of information or causal influences through space. It is a fundamental constant of nature and plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe.

To summarize, while permeability and permittivity are properties related to the propagation of electromagnetic fields in a medium, they are not directly related to the speed of causation. The speed of causation is typically considered to be the speed of light, which is independent of permittivity and permeability.

## Judea Pearl's view on causation
In [[Judea Pearl|Judea Pearl's]] framework, causation refers to the relationship between [[causation|cause and effect]], specifically focusing on the question of how causes lead to effects in a systematic manner. Judea Pearl is a prominent computer scientist and philosopher known for his work in causal inference and the development of causal graphical models.

According to Pearl's causal framework, causation is distinct from mere correlation or statistical association. While correlation captures the statistical relationship between variables, causation delves into understanding the underlying mechanisms and dependencies that give rise to the observed associations.

Pearl emphasizes the importance of counterfactuals in understanding causation. Counterfactuals refer to hypothetical statements about what would have happened if certain conditions were different. They enable us to reason about the causal effects of interventions or changes in variables.

Pearl's framework relies on the notion of causal models, which involve the use of causal graphs or [[Directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graphs]] ([[Directed acyclic graph|DAGs]]) to represent causal relationships between variables. In these graphs, variables are represented as nodes, and directed edges indicate causal dependencies or influences.

Causal inference in Pearl's framework involves using [[Data|data]] and causal models to make inferences about causal relationships. It includes techniques such as do-calculus, which enables researchers to compute the effects of interventions or to estimate causal effects from observational data using specific assumptions and identification conditions.

Pearl's work on causation has contributed to the development of a rigorous and systematic approach to understanding cause and effect relationships, providing a foundation for causal inference and reasoning. His framework has been influential in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, epidemiology, and social sciences, where understanding and identifying causal relationships are crucial for making informed decisions and understanding complex systems.

It is important to note that Pearl's framework on causation is just one perspective among various philosophical and scientific discussions on the nature and interpretation of causation.
