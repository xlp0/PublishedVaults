According to [[Donald Hoffman]], [[Conscious Agency]] refers to the idea that conscious experiences are not simply passive observations of the world, but active constructs created by our minds. In other words, our perceptions are not direct representations of reality but rather interpretations shaped by our mental processes.

Hoffman argues that our perceptions are not designed to provide an accurate depiction of the external world but rather to aid in our survival and reproductive success. He suggests that evolution has shaped our senses to prioritize fitness over truth. As a result, what we perceive as reality is actually a simplified and distorted version of the true nature of the world.

In terms of [[Consciousness]], Hoffman proposes that it is not limited to humans or animals but can potentially exist in any system capable of generating adaptive behavior. He suggests that consciousness is an intrinsic property of information processing systems, which includes both biological organisms and potentially artificial intelligence.

Hoffman's ideas about Conscious Agency have far-reaching implications. They challenge some fundamental assumptions about the nature of reality and raise questions about how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. According to his theory, what we perceive as reality is just a small fraction of what actually exists, and there may be aspects of existence that are completely beyond our comprehension.

Overall, Donald Hoffman's concept of Conscious Agency invites us to question our basic assumptions about perception and consciousness, encouraging us to explore new ways of understanding ourselves and the world around us.
