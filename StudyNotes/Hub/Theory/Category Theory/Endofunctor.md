What is an Endofunctor?

An [[Endofunctor|endofunctor]] is a [[Functor|functor]] that maps a category to itself. In other words, it is a function that takes objects and morphisms from a category and produces new objects and morphisms within the same category. This allows for the transformation or manipulation of objects and morphisms within the same category using the properties and structure defined by the category itself. Endofunctors are commonly used in category theory to study the relationships and structures within categories.
