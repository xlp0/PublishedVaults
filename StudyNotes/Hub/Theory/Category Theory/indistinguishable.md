Indistinguishable is an adjective that means not able to be identified or differentiated because of similarities. It refers to things that are so similar or identical that they cannot be distinguished from each other.

[[Equivalence]], on the other hand, is a noun that refers to the state of being equal in value, function, amount, or significance. It implies similarity or comparability between two or more entities in terms of quality, meaning, or effect. Equivalence does not necessarily imply complete identity but rather a close similarity or equal worth.
