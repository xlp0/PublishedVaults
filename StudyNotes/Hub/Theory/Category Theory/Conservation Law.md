#Symmetry 

A conservation law is a fundamental principle in physics that states that a particular physical property or quantity remains constant in a closed system over time. In other words, the total amount of a specific quantity is conserved and does not change regardless of any transformations or interactions that occur within the system.

Conservation laws are derived from [[Symmetry|symmetries]] in nature, such as time translation symmetry and spatial translation symmetry. They provide important insights into various physical phenomena and play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of systems at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.

Some examples of conservation laws include:

1. Conservation of energy: The total energy within a closed system remains constant, although it can be transformed from one form to another (e.g., potential energy to kinetic energy).

2. Conservation of momentum: The total momentum (mass times velocity) within a closed system remains constant unless external forces act upon it.

3. Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum (mass times velocity times radius) within a closed system remains constant unless external torques act upon it.

4. Conservation of electric charge: The total electric charge within a closed system remains constant, meaning that no charge is created or destroyed.

5. Conservation of mass: In non-relativistic scenarios, the total mass within a closed system remains constant, implying that mass cannot be created or destroyed (according to the law of conservation of mass).

These conservation laws serve as fundamental principles that govern the behavior and interactions of particles, fields, and systems in physics.
