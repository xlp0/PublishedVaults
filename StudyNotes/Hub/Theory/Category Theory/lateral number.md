The term "lateral number" is a deprecated term for [[imaginary number|imaginary numbers]]. Imaginary numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the product of a real number and the imaginary unit i, where i is defined as the square root of negative one.

The term "lateral number" was coined by RenÃ© Descartes, who thought that imaginary numbers were not real numbers because they could not be represented on a number line. However, imaginary numbers are now accepted as a valid part of mathematics, and they are used in many different fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

In terms of imaginary numbers, a lateral number is simply an imaginary number. There is no need to use the term "lateral number" because imaginary numbers are already well-understood and accepted.

Here are some examples of imaginary numbers:

- 5i
- -3i
- 4i + 5i
- 2i - 3i

These are all numbers that can be expressed as the product of a real number and the imaginary unit i. They are all valid imaginary numbers, and they can be used in any mathematical calculation that involves imaginary numbers.

The term "lateral number" is no longer used in mathematics, but it is still sometimes used in popular culture. For example, the Star Trek character Data refers to imaginary numbers as "lateral numbers" in the episode "Rascals".
