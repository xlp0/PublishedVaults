# Caveats
According to [[John Peloquin|Youtuber blargoner]]:
> [[Monad]] enables [[Composability|composition]] in context!

This statement is a succinct, yet powerful interpretation of [[Monad]]. One should watch the whole series on [[Category theory]] by [[John Peloquin]].


# More detailed material
In computer programming, a [[Monad]] is a design pattern used to structure and facilitate the composition of code that deals with side effects, such as input/output (IO) operations or state manipulation. It is primarily associated with functional programming languages like Haskell, but the concept can be applied in other languages as well.

At its core, a Monad is defined by three components:

1. A type constructor: This defines the data structure that represents a computation or value within the Monad. It typically wraps around a value of another type.

2. A unit function (also known as "return" or "pure"): This lifts a value of any type into the Monad's context. It takes a plain value and wraps it inside the Monad.

3. A bind function (also known as ">>=" or "flatMap"): This allows sequencing of computations within the Monad. It takes a computation in the Monad's context, applies a function to extract its contained value, and returns a new computation in the same Monad's context.

The key feature of Monads is their ability to chain computations together in a way that ensures proper handling of side effects and maintains code purity. They provide an abstraction for composing code that deals with impure operations without sacrificing referential transparency.

Monads also often come with additional functions specific to their purpose, such as error handling (Maybe monad), asynchronous operations (Future/Promise monad), or state management (State monad).

By using Monads, programmers can write code that is easier to reason about, modular, and maintainable. They enable separation of concerns by allowing side effect operations to be encapsulated within specific Monads while keeping pure functions clean and free from those effects.


One of the key benefits of monads is that they enable us to separate the concerns of side-effect-inducing computation from pure code. This separation allows us to reason about and test pure functions in isolation, without considering the potential side effects. By isolating side effects, we can achieve greater modularity and reusability in our codebase.

Monads also provide a powerful abstraction for composing side-effect-inducing computations. With monads, we can chain together multiple computations that produce side effects, while still maintaining a clean and readable code structure. This composability is essential in functional programming where immutability and function composition are emphasized.

Additionally, monads provide a clear interface for handling errors and exceptions. By using monadic operations like `flatMap` or `bind`, we can propagate errors through our computations in a controlled manner. This helps us write more robust and predictable code by explicitly handling error cases.

Moreover, monads offer an elegant solution for managing mutable states within functional programming languages. By providing operations like `map` or `flatMap`, we can transform stateful computations while keeping the state itself encapsulated within the monad instance. This approach promotes immutability and avoids global mutable variables.

Overall, Monads provide an elegant way to handle side effects in functional programming languages while maintaining code purity and composability. They allow us to encapsulate impure computations within a pure context, providing a structured and consistent way to handle effects such as state, exceptions, and non-determinism.

In summary, Monads are an important concept in functional programming that allow us to handle side effects while preserving code purity and composability. They provide a clear abstraction for dealing with impure computations such as state manipulation or error handling, enabling us to write more modular and maintainable code.
