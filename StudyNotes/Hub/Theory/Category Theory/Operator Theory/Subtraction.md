In operator theory, subtraction refers to the operation of subtracting one operator from another.

An operator is a mathematical object that operates on a function or vector space to produce another function or vector space. In the context of operator theory, operators are usually represented as matrices.

The subtraction of two operators A and B is defined as a new operator C, denoted as C = A - B. The result of this operation is an operator that, when applied to a function or vector, subtracts the action of B from the action of A.

Mathematically, if A and B are linear operators on a given vector space, then for any vector x in that space, the subtraction of A and B can be defined as:

(A - B)x = Ax - Bx

This means that for every input vector x, the resulting vector after applying the subtraction operator C will be obtained by first applying A to x and then subtracting the result obtained by applying B to x.

Subtraction of operators has several important properties. It is distributive over addition and scalar multiplication, meaning that (A - B) + C = A + (C - B) and k(A - B) = kA - kB for any operators A, B, and C and any scalar k. It also satisfies other algebraic properties like associativity.

Subtraction of operators plays a crucial role in various areas of mathematics and physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, where operators represent physical observables such as position or momentum, subtraction can be used to calculate differences between measurements or changes in physical quantities.

## Antisymmetric properties
As the [[@allanglesHowSubtractionMakes2023|video on subtraction by All Angles]] shows, to better represent antisymmetric operators, such as [[Subtraction]] and [[Division]], it would be more congruent to choose an antisymmetric shape, such as an arrow to denote these operators. For symmetric operators, such as [[Add]] and [[Multiply]], they are clearly symmetric in nature, and the shape of these operators are adequate. However, to reduce mental efforts in representing antisymmetric operations, such as [[Subtraction]] and [[Division]], it would be more elegant to choose a shape such as a single-headed arrow to represent each of them.

Overall, subtraction in operator theory provides a way to combine and manipulate operators to study their properties and relationships within various mathematical frameworks.
