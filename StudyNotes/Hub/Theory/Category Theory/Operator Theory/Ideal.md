In mathematical analysis, an ideal is a subset of a given set that satisfies certain properties. Specifically, an ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements from the ring. 

More formally, let R be a ring and I be a subset of R. I is called an ideal if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. I is closed under addition: For any x, y in I, their sum x + y is also in I.
2. I is closed under multiplication by elements from R: For any r in R and x in I, the product rx is also in I.

In other words, an ideal is a set that contains all possible sums and products of its elements with elements from the ring. Ideals are important in mathematical analysis as they allow for studying various algebraic structures and properties within the context of a given ring.

# What is the relation between Ideal and Convolution?

The relation between [[Ideal]] and [[Convolution]] is that the Ideal function is often used as a filter in the process of Convolution. 

In signal processing and image processing, convolution is an operation that combines two functions to produce a third function. It involves integrating one function (often called the input signal) with a second function (often called the impulse response) to produce an output signal.

The Ideal function, also known as the Ideal low-pass filter or Ideal high-pass filter, is a mathematical concept that represents an idealized filter with a certain frequency response. It has a rectangular frequency response, allowing only certain frequencies to pass through while attenuating others.

When performing convolution, the impulse response of the system being modeled is convolved with the input signal to produce an output signal. In many cases, the impulse response used in convolution is an approximation of an Ideal function. This means that during convolution, the input signal is filtered using the frequency response of the Ideal function.

By using convolution with an Ideal function, specific frequencies can be selectively emphasized or attenuated in the output signal. This allows for various filtering operations such as low-pass filtering or high-pass filtering to be performed on signals or images.

In summary, the relation between Ideal and Convolution is that Ideal functions are often used as filters in the process of Convolution to selectively emphasize or attenuate specific frequencies in signals or images.
