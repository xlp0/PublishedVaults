The Pacioli Group is a mathematical construction that [[David P. Ellerman]] in his [[@ellermanMathematicsDoubleEntry1985|paper]], developed to explain the double-entry bookkeeping system. It is named after [[Luca Pacioli]], the Italian mathematician who is credited with codifying the double-entry bookkeeping system in the 15th century.

The Pacioli Group is a set of ordered pairs of numbers, where each pair represents a transaction. The first number in the pair is the debit, and the second number is the credit. The sum of the debits in a group must equal the sum of the credits in the group.

Ellerman argues that the Pacioli Group is a mathematical representation of the double-entry bookkeeping system. He also argues that the Pacioli Group can be used to understand the nature of money and accounting.

Ellerman's work on the Pacioli Group has been influential in the field of accounting. It has been used to develop new theories of accounting and to improve the understanding of the double-entry bookkeeping system.

Here are some of the key features of the Pacioli Group:

- It is a set of ordered pairs of numbers.
- The first number in the pair is the debit.
- The second number in the pair is the credit.
- The sum of the debits in a group must equal the sum of the credits in the group.
- The Pacioli Group can be used to represent a transaction.
- The Pacioli Group can be used to understand the nature of money and accounting.

The Pacioli Group is a complex mathematical construction, but it is a powerful tool for understanding the double-entry bookkeeping system. It has been used to develop new theories of accounting and to improve the understanding of the double-entry bookkeeping system.
