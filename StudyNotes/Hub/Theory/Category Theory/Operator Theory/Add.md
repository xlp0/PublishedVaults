In operator theory, the addition or plus operator is defined as a binary operation that combines two elements of a set to produce another element of the same set. In mathematical terms, it is denoted by the symbol "+". The set on which addition is defined can vary depending on the context, but commonly it refers to sets of numbers like integers, real numbers, or complex numbers.

The addition operator possesses certain [[Symmetry|symmetric properties]] in relation to the multiplier. These properties are closely related to the concept of commutativity and distributivity. 

1. Commutativity: The addition operator is commutative, which means that changing the order of operands does not affect the result. For any two elements "a" and "b" in a set, "a + b = b + a". This property allows for easy manipulation and rearrangement of terms in mathematical equations.

2. Distributivity: The addition operator also satisfies the distributive property. It means that addition can be distributed over multiplication or vice versa. For example, for any three elements "a", "b", and "c" in a set, "a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)". This property plays a crucial role in various algebraic manipulations.

On the other hand, [[Subtraction|subtraction]] is another mathematical operation denoted by the "-" symbol. It differs from addition in terms of its symmetric properties.

1. Non-commutativity: Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative. Changing the order of operands produces different results. For any two elements "a" and "b" in a set, "a - b ≠ b - a". This property restricts rearrangement possibilities when working with subtraction operations.

2. Non-distributivity: Subtraction does not satisfy distributive properties like addition does. Distributing subtraction over multiplication or vice versa would yield incorrect results in most cases. For example, for any three elements "a", "b", and "c" in a set, "a * (b - c) ≠ (a * b) - (a * c)". This non-distributive property complicates algebraic manipulations involving subtraction.

In summary, the addition operator in operator theory has symmetric properties such as commutativity and distributivity, enabling easy manipulation of mathematical expressions. In contrast, the subtraction operator is non-commutative and non-distributive, leading to differences in its symmetric properties compared to addition.
