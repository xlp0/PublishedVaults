Quaternions are a mathematical concept invented by Irish mathematician Sir [[William Hamilton|William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1843. They are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers and provide a way to represent rotations in three-dimensional space.

Hamilton was born on August 4, 1805, in Dublin, Ireland. He showed exceptional mathematical abilities from an early age and made significant contributions to various branches of mathematics throughout his career. However, it was his development of quaternions that is considered his most famous and influential work.

The invention of quaternions came to Hamilton during a walk along the Royal Canal in Dublin. He had been struggling to find a way to extend complex numbers into three dimensions when suddenly, the solution struck him. He famously scratched the fundamental equation "i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1" onto the stone Broom Bridge, marking the birth of quaternions.

Quaternions introduced the concept of using four coordinates (a scalar term and three imaginary terms) to represent points in space and rotations around them. This provided a more elegant and efficient way to handle complex rotational calculations compared to other methods available at that time.

Despite their initial skepticism from some mathematicians, quaternions found applications in many fields such as computer graphics, robotics, aerospace engineering, and physics. They are still widely used today in computer animation, video games, virtual reality systems, and other areas where precise rotations need to be represented.

# How does quaternions relate to T-accounts

From the outset, [[Quaternions]] and [[T-accounts]] seems to be unrelated concepts in different fields. 

Quaternions are mathematical entities that extend the concept of complex numbers to higher dimensions. They are commonly used in computer graphics, robotics, and physics to represent rotations in three-dimensional space. Quaternions have properties that make them efficient for representing and calculating rotations.

On the other hand, T-accounts are a concept used in accounting to represent the financial transactions of a business. They consist of two sides: the left side represents debits (or decreases in assets) and the right side represents credits (or increases in liabilities or equity). T-accounts are used to analyze, track, and summarize financial transactions.

However, [[William Hamilton]] saw the connection amongst these two different data representation approaches and influenced the creation of [[Matrix Algebra]] to unite the two fields.
