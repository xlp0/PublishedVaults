The word "magic" is commonly used to describe a concept that goes beyond the laws of nature, involving supernatural or mystical phenomena. It typically refers to the ability to manipulate or influence events and objects through supernatural means, often associated with spells, incantations, or rituals. The idea of magic has roots in ancient civilizations and is present in various cultures and mythologies throughout history.

The notion that advanced technologies should act like magic can be traced back to [[Arthur C. Clarke]], a renowned science fiction writer and futurist. In his 1973 essay titled "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination," Clarke formulated what is now known as [[Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic|Clarke's Third Law]]: "[[Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic]]." This idea suggests that as technology progresses and becomes more sophisticated, it may appear magical or inexplicable to those who do not understand its workings.

Clarke's statement implies that when technology reaches a certain level of complexity and capability, it becomes so advanced that it defies our understanding and seems like magic. This concept has been influential in shaping people's perceptions of futuristic technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, nanotechnology, or even space exploration.

The notion that advanced technologies should resemble magic has also had an impact on the development of user interfaces and user experience design. Technology companies strive to create seamless and intuitive interactions with their products so that users experience them as effortlessly as performing a magical act.

## A technical way to present magic
According to [[Arthur C. Clarke]], "any sufficiently advanced technology" is indistinguishable from [[Magic|magic]]. However, a cryptographic technique known as [[ZKP|Zero Knowledge Proof]] can be thought of as a technical or mathematically correct method for producing magic. The terms [[Magic]] and [[ZKP]] should be connected because magicians frequently do not wish to disclose information about their tricks after performing them. Moreover, [[ZKP|Zero Knowledge Proof]] or [[ZKP]] for short is a quantitative and systematic method for ensuring the secrecy of deception. The existence of such a technical approach to conceal information with a functional demonstration of "proof" is also a significant advancement for a variety of social applications, including [[Self-Sovereign Identity]] and [[payment channels]] in [[cryptocurrency]] transactions. ZKP can be viewed as the idealized measurement of magical effectiveness. In many cases, [[ZKP]] mechanisms are considered to be the requirement for these social applications. In other words, [[Magic]] is a necessary tool to enable scalable social interactions independent of blind faith or trust.

# Conclusion

Overall, the idea that advanced technologies should act like magic reflects our innate fascination with the mysterious and extraordinary. It highlights the potential for technology to push boundaries and transform our lives in ways previously unimaginable.
