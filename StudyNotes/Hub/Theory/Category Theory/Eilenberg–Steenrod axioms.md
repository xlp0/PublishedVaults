The [Eilenbergâ€“Steenrod axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg-Steenrod_axioms) are a set of properties that any homology theory must satisfy. They were formulated by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Norman Steenrod]] in the mid-20th century and have become an important foundation for algebraic topology.

There are three main axioms in the Eilenberg-Steenrod framework:

1. Homotopy Invariance: This axiom states that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, their homology groups should be isomorphic. Homotopy equivalence is a relation between spaces that captures the idea of continuous deformation, so this axiom ensures that homology is a topological invariant.

2. Excision: This axiom asserts that if a subspace A is "small enough" inside a larger space X, then the relative homology groups of X with respect to A should be isomorphic to the absolute homology groups of X/A (the quotient space). Intuitively, excision allows us to focus on small parts of a space without changing its overall homology.

3. Dimension Axiom: This axiom states that the homology groups of a point (a zero-dimensional space) should only have one nonzero group in dimension zero, and all other groups should be trivial. In other words, the zeroth homology group should capture connectedness information about a space.

These axioms provide a rigorous framework for constructing and studying various types of homology theories, such as singular homology, simplicial homology, and cellular homology. By ensuring these properties hold true, mathematicians can develop powerful tools to understand the topological properties of spaces.

The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms have had profound implications in algebraic topology and related fields. They allow for comparisons between different types of homology theories and provide a common language for discussing their properties. Additionally, they have led to important developments like the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which relates homology theories to cohomology theories.

In summary, the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms provide a solid foundation for homology theory. They ensure that homology is a well-defined invariant of spaces and enable mathematicians to study and compare different types of homology theories in a systematic way.
