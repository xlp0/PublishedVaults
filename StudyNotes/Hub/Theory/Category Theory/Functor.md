A functor is a concept in [[Category theory|category theory]] that refers to an object or a mapping between categories. It can be thought of as a structure-preserving map between categories, which means it preserves the relationships and properties of the objects and morphisms ([[Arrow|arrows]]) within the categories.

More specifically, a functor F consists of two components:
1. A mapping from objects in one category (called the domain category) to objects in another category (called the codomain category).
2. A mapping from morphisms in the domain category to morphisms in the codomain category.

These mappings must satisfy certain properties:
- Identity preservation: The identity morphism of an object in the domain category must be mapped to the identity morphism of the corresponding object in the codomain category.
- Composition preservation: The composition of two morphisms in the domain category must be mapped to the composition of their corresponding morphisms in the codomain category.

Functors play a fundamental role in connecting different categories and studying their relationships. They allow us to transfer concepts, properties, and structures from one category to another, enabling us to reason about abstract mathematical structures more effectively.
