[[Category theory]] is often referred to as "abstract nonsense" because it deals with highly abstract and general concepts that can be difficult to grasp intuitively. It focuses on studying mathematical structures and relationships between them, rather than specific objects or computations. This level of abstraction can make it challenging for those who are used to more concrete, applied mathematics.

The term "abstract nonsense" was coined by mathematician [[Norman Steenrod]] in the 1940s. He used it in a playful and somewhat derogatory manner to describe certain aspects of category theory that he found particularly abstract and removed from practical applications. However, it is worth noting that Steenrod himself made significant contributions to algebraic topology, an area that heavily uses category theory later on. Despite the initial skepticism, category theory has gained recognition and importance in various branches of mathematics and computer science over the years.
