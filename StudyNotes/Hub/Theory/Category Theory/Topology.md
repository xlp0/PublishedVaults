#topology

Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching or bending. It deals with the concepts of continuity, proximity, and connectivity. It is also known as the study of "rubber sheet geometry" or [[Deformable]] geometry.

One of the fundamental concepts in topology is the notion of a topological space. A topological space consists of a set of points and a collection of subsets called open sets that satisfy certain axioms. These axioms determine which collections of points can be considered as "close" or "near" to each other.

Topological spaces can have different properties, such as being [[Connection|connected]] (where there are no disconnected parts) or being [[Compactness|compact]] (where every open cover has a finite subcover). There are various types of topologies, including metric topology (based on distance), order topology (based on order relations), and algebraic topology (based on algebraic structures).

Topology also studies various topological properties and concepts, such as continuity, [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphisms]] (which describe when two spaces can be transformed into each other), compactness, connectedness, and separation axioms. It explores the relationships between these properties and how they affect the structure and behavior of spaces.

## The birth of Topology
[[Leonhard Euler]], an 18th-century Swiss mathematician, is credited with inventing topology through his work on the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem. He realized that the solution to this problem did not depend on distances or angles but only on the connections between the bridges. This led Euler to develop a new branch of mathematics called topology, which studies the properties of objects that remain unchanged under continuous deformations such as stretching and bending. In essence, Euler's work in solving this problem laid the foundation for the field of topology. A short video on this history is [here](@whatmakesittick_BirthTopologyHistory2020).

## Applications of Topology

Topology has applications in various fields, including physics, computer science, engineering, and biology. In physics, for example, topology plays a crucial role in understanding phenomena like phase transitions and the behavior of materials. In computer science and engineering, it is used in areas such as network design and optimization. In biology, topology helps analyze protein folding patterns and DNA structures.

## The reason that everyone must study Topology
[[Ian Prado]] posted a lecture by a Professor at University of Texas Austin with the [[@ianpradoTopTenReasons2020|Top Ten Reasons Why Everyone Should Study Topology]]. The three main reasons why [[Hsueh-Yung Benjamin Koo|Hsueh-Yung Koo]] think everyone must study [[Topology]] can be summed up in the following three points:
1. [[Topology]] is the study of [[Connection|connections]], and everything came into being when people realized, among other things, that things have relationships. See [[@morphocularMostImportantConcept2023|Compactness/Connectedness/Covering]].
2. Topology is a well-developed area of mathematics with courses and materials that connect to all other areas of math and many fields of application. 
3. Topology is being used to understand and do [[Data Science]] better. A lot of work has gone into developing a topological method to analyze data, known as [[Topological Data Analysis]]([[TDA]]). This new field will be used in everyday data use and all other social and physical functions, such as authentication, checking the truth of data, and the [[Internet of Things]].

# Conclusion

Overall, topology provides a powerful framework for studying spatial relationships in both abstract mathematical settings and real-world applications. Its principles help us understand the fundamental structure underlying space and its transformations.
