Galois Theory is a branch of algebra that studies field extensions, which are mathematical structures that generalize the concept of numbers. It was developed by the French mathematician [[Ã‰variste Galois]] in the 19th century. 

Galois Theory provides a framework to understand the structure and properties of field extensions, particularly those that are obtained by adding roots of polynomials to a given field. This theory focuses on studying the symmetries, or automorphisms, that preserve the algebraic structure of these field extensions.

One of the main goals of Galois Theory is to determine whether a given polynomial equation can be solved by radicals, i.e., whether its roots can be expressed using only basic arithmetic operations and taking nth roots. This is closely related to finding solvable groups associated with these equations.

Galois Theory also establishes a connection between field extensions and group theory. It shows that there is a correspondence between certain subgroups of an extension's automorphism group (called Galois groups) and intermediate fields between the original field and its extension. This correspondence allows for analyzing the relationship between fields and symmetries in a more abstract manner.

Overall, Galois Theory provides powerful tools for understanding the algebraic structure of fields and solving polynomial equations. It has applications in various areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry, cryptography, and physics.
