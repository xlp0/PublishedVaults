Origametry is a term that combines the words "[[Origami|origami]]" and "[[Geometry|geometry]]" and refers to the study and exploration of the mathematical principles involved in origami. Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, where intricate designs are created by folding a single sheet of paper without cutting or gluing.

Origametry involves understanding the geometric principles behind origami designs, such as how to create various shapes, angles, and dimensions using folding techniques. It delves into concepts like symmetry, proportionality, and tessellation. By applying mathematical concepts to origami, artists and mathematicians can create complex and beautiful structures.

Mathematics plays a crucial role in origametry by providing a systematic approach to designing new origami models. Concepts like fractions, ratios, symmetry groups, graph theory, and topology are utilized to understand the underlying principles of folding patterns. Mathematicians have even developed algorithms for creating origami designs or predicting how a piece of paper will fold.

Origametry has practical applications beyond art as well. It has been used in engineering to design foldable structures like solar panels for space exploration or collapsible medical devices. Understanding the mathematics behind origami can also help develop new materials with special properties or improve techniques for folding materials efficiently.

Overall, origametry combines artistic creativity with scientific inquiry by exploring the mathematical foundations of origami. It offers a unique perspective on geometry while pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved through paper folding.
