Tell me about Kan extensions

Kan extensions are a concept in [[Category theory|category theory]], a branch of mathematics that studies abstract structures and relationships between them. Specifically, Kan extensions relate to the notion of functors between categories.

In category theory, a functor is a mapping between categories that preserves the structure and relationships of the objects and morphisms within those categories. Functors can be thought of as a way to transfer information from one category to another.

A Kan extension is a way to extend or "lift" a functor along another functor. More formally, given two categories A and B, and two functors F: A → B and G: A → C, where C is another category, the Kan extension of F along G is an extension H: C → B such that H ∘ G = F.

There are two types of Kan extensions: left Kan extensions and right Kan extensions. Left Kan extensions generalize the idea of colimits in category theory, whereas right Kan extensions generalize the idea of limits.

Left Kan extensions are used to "fill in" missing information in a diagram or construction by extending it horizontally. They allow us to define new objects or morphisms in B by using information from C. Right Kan extensions, on the other hand, extend diagrams vertically by providing missing information from above.

Kan extensions have various applications within mathematics. They are often used to prove results about [[Adjoint functors|adjoint functors]] (a key concept in category theory), provide solutions to lifting problems in various mathematical contexts, and establish connections between different areas of mathematics.

Overall, Kan extensions provide a powerful tool for understanding and studying relationships between functors in category theory. They allow for the transfer of information across different categories and help uncover deeper connections between mathematical structures.
