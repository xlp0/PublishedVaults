In mathematics, a dual refers to a mathematical object that is related to another object by a certain concept of duality. The concept of duality often arises in various branches of mathematics, such as linear algebra, topology, and functional analysis.

In linear algebra, the dual space of a vector space V refers to the set of all linear functionals on V. A linear functional is a linear map that assigns a scalar value to each vector in V. The dual space is itself a vector space, and it has the same dimension as V if V is finite-dimensional.

In topology, the concept of duality arises in the context of topological spaces. Given a topological space X, its dual space refers to another topological space that captures certain properties or characteristics of X from a different perspective. For example, the dual space may swap open sets with closed sets or continuous functions with co-continuous functions.

In functional analysis, the concept of duality extends to include more general objects such as [[Banach spaces]] and [[Hilbert spaces]]. In this context, the dual space refers to the set of all bounded linear functionals on the given space.

Overall, duality in mathematics provides a way to study mathematical objects from different angles or viewpoints and often leads to deeper insights and connections between different areas of mathematics.
