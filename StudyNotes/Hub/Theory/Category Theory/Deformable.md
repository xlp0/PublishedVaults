The word "[[Deformable|deformation]]" refers to the process of changing the shape or structure of an object. In mathematics, it is often used in the context of topology to describe a continuous transformation of one topological space into another. 

In [[Topology|topology]], a deformation is a continuous mapping that gradually changes the shape of a space while preserving its essential properties. This concept allows mathematicians to study and compare different shapes or spaces by considering them as deformations of each other.

Deformation theory is an important tool in topology as it helps in understanding and classifying different topological spaces. By studying how one space can be deformed into another, mathematicians can identify topological properties that are preserved throughout the deformation process. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and properties of these spaces.

Overall, deformation plays a crucial role in topology as it provides a way to analyze and relate different shapes and spaces by considering their continuous transformations.
