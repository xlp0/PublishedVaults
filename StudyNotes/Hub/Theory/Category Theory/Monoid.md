A monoid is a mathematical structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation and an identity element. More formally, a monoid is defined as a tuple (M, *, e), where M is the set, * is the binary operation, and e is the identity element.

The binary operation * must be associative, which means that for any three elements a, b, c in M, the equation (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) holds true. This property allows for grouping operations without changing the result.

The identity element e is an element of M such that for any element a in M, the equations e * a = a and a * e = a hold true. The identity element acts as a neutral element under the binary operation.

# Examples of Monoid
Examples of monoids include:
1. The set of natural numbers (including zero) with addition as the binary operation and zero as the identity element.
2. The set of non-negative integers with multiplication as the binary operation and one as the identity element.
3. The set of strings with concatenation as the binary operation and an empty string as the identity element.

Monoids find applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science, including algebraic structures, formal languages, programming languages, and database theory.
