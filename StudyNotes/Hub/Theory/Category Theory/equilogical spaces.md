According to [[Dana Scott]], equilogical spaces are a generalization of topological spaces that incorporate a notion of equality between points. In equilogical spaces, the notion of equality is not limited to just [[topological equivalence]], but rather includes additional structure that allows for finer distinctions between points.

Scott introduced the concept of equilogical spaces in his work on domain theory, which is a mathematical framework for modeling computation and program semantics. Equilogical spaces are used as a foundation for studying the behavior of functions and computations in domain theory.

In equilogical spaces, equality is defined by an equivalence relation that satisfies certain properties. This equivalence relation captures not only topological closeness but also other notions of indistinguishability between points. The additional structure provided by equilogical spaces allows for more precise reasoning about equality and approximation in domain theory.

Equilogical spaces have been extensively studied and applied in various areas of mathematics and computer science, particularly in the fields related to logic, computation, and semantics.
