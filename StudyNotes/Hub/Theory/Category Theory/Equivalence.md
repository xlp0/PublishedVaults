Aliases: Equality

According to [[Vladmir Voevodsky|Vodevosky]], two objects in a category are said to be equivalent if there exists a zigzag of morphisms between them such that composing these morphisms in any order gives an isomorphism. In other words, if there exists a sequence of morphisms f_1, f_2, ..., f_n such that the composition f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_2 ∘ f_1 is an isomorphism and each individual morphism f_i is also an isomorphism.

In the context of Homotopy Theory, Voevodsky's notion of equivalence can be applied to spaces or objects with additional structure that can be studied using homotopy theory. Two spaces are said to be homotopy equivalent if there exists a zigzag of continuous maps between them such that composing these maps in any order gives a homotopy equivalence. He later founder the [[Univalent Foundations]] program.

This notion of equivalence allows for more flexibility and captures the idea that two objects can have different structures but still share important homotopical properties. It is a useful concept in Homotopy Theory as it allows for the comparison and classification of objects based on their homotopical behavior.

## Equality explained

Equality is a fundamental concept in mathematics and logic. In formal terms, equality is a relation that holds between two objects when they have the same value, quantity, or characteristics. There are several main properties of equality that help define its behavior and ensure consistency. The key properties of equality are:

1. Reflexivity: Reflexivity means that every object is equal to itself. In other words, for any object or element "x," the equation x = x always holds true. This property establishes the basic foundation of equality.
    
2. Symmetry: Symmetry states that if two objects are equal, then the order of the objects does not matter. In symbolic terms, if x = y, then y = x. This property allows us to switch the positions of the objects without affecting the truth of the equality statement.
    
3. Transitivity: Transitivity states that if two objects are equal to a third object, then they must be equal to each other. Symbolically, if x = y and y = z, then x = z. This property allows us to establish chains of equality and make logical deductions based on previously established equalities.
    
4. Substitution: Substitution, also known as the principle of substitutivity, states that if two objects are equal, they can be substituted for each other in any equation, expression, or statement without changing the truth value. Symbolically, if x = y, then substituting x for y (or vice versa) in any valid context will not alter the [[Correctness|correctness]] of the statement.
    

These properties of equality are fundamental for reasoning about equations and mathematical structures. They allow us to manipulate equations, make logical deductions, and establish equivalences between different expressions or statements. By applying these properties, we can simplify equations, solve problems, and prove mathematical theorems.

When it comes to web pages, there are several online platforms dedicated to promoting equality and providing information on related topics. Some notable websites include:

1. United Nations Women (unwomen.org) - The official website of UN Women offers resources, research, and news related to gender equality worldwide.

2. Amnesty International (amnesty.org) - Amnesty International's website covers various human rights issues, including equal rights advocacy across different contexts.

3. Human Rights Watch (hrw.org) - Human Rights Watch focuses on human rights violations globally, including discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.

4. Equality Now (equalitynow.org) - This international organization works towards protecting and promoting the rights of women and girls globally by advocating for legislative reforms and policy changes.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other books and web pages that address the topic of equality from different perspectives.

All these ideas are to be summarized in the notion of [[Equivalence]].
