Aliases: Equality

According to [[Vladmir Voevodsky|Vodevosky]], two objects in a category are said to be equivalent if there exists a zigzag of morphisms between them such that composing these morphisms in any order gives an isomorphism. In other words, if there exists a sequence of morphisms f_1, f_2, ..., f_n such that the composition f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_2 ∘ f_1 is an isomorphism and each individual morphism f_i is also an isomorphism.

In the context of Homotopy Theory, Voevodsky's notion of equivalence can be applied to spaces or objects with additional structure that can be studied using homotopy theory. Two spaces are said to be homotopy equivalent if there exists a zigzag of continuous maps between them such that composing these maps in any order gives a homotopy equivalence. He later founder the [[Univalent Foundations]] program.

This notion of equivalence allows for more flexibility and captures the idea that two objects can have different structures but still share important homotopical properties. It is a useful concept in Homotopy Theory as it allows for the comparison and classification of objects based on their homotopical behavior.

## Equality explained

Equality is a fundamental concept in mathematics and logic. In formal terms, equality is a relation that holds between two objects when they have the same value, quantity, or characteristics. There are several main properties of equality that help define its behavior and ensure consistency. The key properties of equality are:

1. Reflexivity: Reflexivity means that every object is equal to itself. In other words, for any object or element "x," the equation x = x always holds true. This property establishes the basic foundation of equality.
    
2. Symmetry: Symmetry states that if two objects are equal, then the order of the objects does not matter. In symbolic terms, if x = y, then y = x. This property allows us to switch the positions of the objects without affecting the truth of the equality statement.
    
3. Transitivity: Transitivity states that if two objects are equal to a third object, then they must be equal to each other. Symbolically, if x = y and y = z, then x = z. This property allows us to establish chains of equality and make logical deductions based on previously established equalities.
    
4. Substitution: Substitution, also known as the principle of substitutivity, states that if two objects are equal, they can be substituted for each other in any equation, expression, or statement without changing the truth value. Symbolically, if x = y, then substituting x for y (or vice versa) in any valid context will not alter the [[Correctness|correctness]] of the statement.
    

These properties of equality are fundamental for reasoning about equations and mathematical structures. They allow us to manipulate equations, make logical deductions, and establish equivalences between different expressions or statements. By applying these properties, we can simplify equations, solve problems, and prove mathematical theorems.

## Equivalence from a Socio-Political View

There are numerous books and web pages available that discuss the topic of equality. Here are a few examples:

1. "The Equality Effect: Improving Life for Everyone" by Danny Dorling - This book explores the impact of inequality on various aspects of our lives and societies, offering evidence-based arguments for why equality is essential.

2. "Why We Can't Wait" by Martin Luther King Jr. - This book delves into the civil rights movement in the United States, discussing the fight for equality and justice during that era.

3. "The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone" by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett - This influential book examines how greater equality leads to improved social and economic outcomes, benefiting individuals as well as societies as a whole.

4. "Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics" by bell hooks - In this accessible book, bell hooks highlights the importance of feminism in achieving social justice and equality for all genders.

5. "We Should All Be Feminists" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie - Based on her TED Talk, this book explores Adichie's personal experiences with gender inequality and calls for a more inclusive society.

When it comes to web pages, there are several online platforms dedicated to promoting equality and providing information on related topics. Some notable websites include:

1. United Nations Women (unwomen.org) - The official website of UN Women offers resources, research, and news related to gender equality worldwide.

2. Amnesty International (amnesty.org) - Amnesty International's website covers various human rights issues, including equal rights advocacy across different contexts.

3. Human Rights Watch (hrw.org) - Human Rights Watch focuses on human rights violations globally, including discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.

4. Equality Now (equalitynow.org) - This international organization works towards protecting and promoting the rights of women and girls globally by advocating for legislative reforms and policy changes.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other books and web pages that address the topic of equality from different perspectives.

## Arguments for Equivalence
Equivalence as a broad and generalized transfer of responsibility or [[Transformation|transformation]] of functionality have many socio-technical implications. Creating a computational framework to identify possible ways ([[Commutator|commutative paths]]) to replace one thing with an equivalent one will lead to many profound implications. In any case, creating a large library of equivalent classes of things may help reduce unnecessary complexity, and therefore enhance performance of decision-making or [[Judgement|judgements]] at a rate that is unprecedented. To reason about the [[Correctness|correctness]] of certain Equivalence relations can be grounded on the data representation of [[Hoare triple|Hoare logic]]. Another data-intensive research direction on [[Correctness|correctness]] concerns can be found in the [[@valgraiWhatWrongLLMs2023|What's wrong wtih LLMs]] talk by [[Thomas G. Dietterich|Thomas Dietterich]]. Overall, the argument for Equivalence should be grounded on a [[Topological Data Analysis]] kind of argument, which shows a systematic way to study [[Deformable|deformable]] shapes. 

## An interesting diagram
In the end of the video on [[@epsilondeltaHowWeSolve2023|How do we solve difficult problems in Math?]], it presented the following diagram:

This diagram shows a [[Commutative Diagram]] that explains a [[Category theory]] way of identifying [[Equivalence|equivalence]]. It is important to note that [[Category theory]] emphasize the idea of [[Natural equivalence]], not just [[Equivalence]].
## Equivalence and Incommensurability
There is a conceptual connection between deformable shapes and paradigm shift, as [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of [[Incommensurability]], when a [[paradigm shift]] or [[Magic|magic]] occurs, liked the [[light bulbs]] before Edison's mass production of them, existing [[Vocabulary|vocabulary]] cannot be composed to express or represent daily observable experience, new terms must be invented to be the label or the equivalence term for this new [[paradigm]]. 

## Equivalence and Indistinguishability
Equivalence refers to a state or condition of being equal or interchangeable. It suggests that two things have the same value, importance, or meaning. For example, in mathematics, two equations are considered equivalent if they have the same solution set.

[[indistinguishable|Indistinguishable]], on the other hand, refers to a state or condition of being impossible to tell apart or differentiate. It implies that two things are so similar in appearance, nature, or quality that they cannot be distinguished from each other. For instance, identical twins are often indistinguishable from each other due to their physical resemblance.

While both words convey a sense of similarity or sameness, equivalence emphasizes equality or interchangeability in value or meaning, whereas indistinguishable focuses on the inability to differentiate between two things due to their extreme similarity. Therefore, the word: "[[Equivalence|equivalence]]" has stronger logical constraints than "[[indistinguishable]]". [[Dana Scott]] also proposed a [[equilogical spaces]], and his work on [Outline of a Mathematical Theory of Computation](app://obsidian.md/@scottOutlineMathematicalTheory1977) is also a must read.

In summary, equivalence suggests equal value or meaning between two things, while indistinguishable implies an inability to tell them apart due to their extreme similarity.

# Conclusion
It should be clear that [[Equivalence]] is not only an abstract idea in mathematics but also a foundational reasoning mechanism to relate to social and physical relations. Equivalence provides a mechanism to transfer or [[transformation|transform]] existing relations or properties to a different carrier, acting like [[Magic]] which offers opportunities for surprises and intentional changes.
