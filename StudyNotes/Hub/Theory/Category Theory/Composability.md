In [[Category theory|category theory]], composability refers to the ability to combine morphisms (arrows) in a category to form new morphisms. It is a fundamental concept that plays a central role in understanding and studying categories.

In a category, you have objects and morphisms. Objects represent entities, while morphisms represent the relationships or transformations between those entities. Composability allows you to connect morphisms in a meaningful way, enabling the construction of complex transformations from simpler ones.

Given two morphisms, say f: A → B and g: B → C, where A, B, and C are objects in the category, composability allows you to "compose" these morphisms to obtain a new morphism h: A → C. This composition is denoted as h = g ∘ f, and it represents applying f first, followed by g.

The composition operator (∘) satisfies the following properties:

1. Associativity: For any three morphisms f: A → B, g: B → C, and h: C → D, their compositions are associative, meaning (h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f). This allows you to chain together multiple morphisms in a category without ambiguity.

2. Identity(恒等): For every object A, there exists an identity morphism idA: A → A, such that for any morphism f: A → B, the compositions idB ∘ f = f and f ∘ idA = f. The identity morphism serves as an identity element for composition and ensures that every morphism can be composed with the appropriate identity morphisms.

Composability is a powerful concept in category theory because it allows for the construction of complex structures from simpler ones by combining morphisms in different ways. It provides a framework for analyzing and reasoning about various mathematical structures and systems, including algebraic structures, topological spaces, and even programming languages. The notion of [[Composability|composability]] is highly related to [[Modularity|modularity]].
