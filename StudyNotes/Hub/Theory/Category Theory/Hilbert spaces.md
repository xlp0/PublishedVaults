A Hilbert space is a mathematical concept in functional analysis, named after the German mathematician David Hilbert. It is a complete inner product space, meaning it is a vector space with an inner product (a mathematical operation that measures the angle between vectors) that is also complete, or contains all its limit points. In other words, it is a space where distances and angles can be defined consistently.

Hilbert spaces have several important properties and applications in mathematics and physics. They are used to study functions, operators, and sequences of vectors. In [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], for example, Hilbert spaces are used to describe the state of a quantum system and the evolution of its wave function over time.

One of the key features of Hilbert spaces is that they allow for infinite-dimensional vectors. Unlike finite-dimensional vector spaces where vectors have a fixed number of components, in Hilbert spaces vectors can have infinitely many components. This makes them particularly suitable for studying continuous functions or systems with an infinite number of possible states.

Overall, Hilbert spaces provide a powerful framework for analyzing and understanding various mathematical and physical phenomena by providing a rich structure for studying vectors and functions in an abstract setting.
