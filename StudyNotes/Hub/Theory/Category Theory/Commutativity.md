What is Commutativity in Category Theory and what is its relationship with Commutative Diagram

Commutativity in Category Theory refers to the property of morphisms to commute with each other. In other words, given two morphisms f and g in a category, if there is a commutative diagram involving these morphisms, it means that applying f and g in any order yields the same result.

A commutative diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between objects and morphisms in a category. It consists of objects as nodes and morphisms as arrows between these nodes. The commutativity of a diagram is determined by the property that composing any two paths from one object to another yields the same result.

The relationship between Commutativity in Category Theory and [[Commutative Diagram|Commutative Diagrams]] is that commutative diagrams are used to visualize and express the concept of commutativity. By representing the morphisms and their compositions as arrows in a diagram, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the relationships between them. Commutative diagrams serve as a tool for depicting and proving commutativity properties in category theory.
