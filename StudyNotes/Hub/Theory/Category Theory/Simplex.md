In topological terms, the term "simplex" refers to a geometric object that is the generalization of a line segment (1-dimensional simplex), a triangle (2-dimensional simplex), and a tetrahedron (3-dimensional simplex) to higher dimensions. 

A simplex in topology is defined as the convex hull of a set of points in Euclidean space. It can be thought of as the simplest possible polytope in any given dimension. For example, a 0-dimensional simplex is simply a point, and a 1-dimensional simplex is a line segment connecting two points.

In general, an n-dimensional simplex consists of n+1 vertices and all the line segments connecting these vertices. These line segments form the edges of the simplex. Furthermore, each vertex is incident to exactly n edges, each edge is incident to exactly two vertices, and each face (higher-dimensional analogs of triangles) is incident to exactly n edges.

Simplexes have several important properties in topology. For instance, they are used as building blocks for constructing more [[Complex|complex]] topological spaces through techniques like triangulation. Additionally, simplicial complexes are often used to approximate more general topological spaces in computational geometry and computer graphics.

Overall, simplexes play a fundamental role in topological discussions due to their simplicity and ability to represent higher-dimensional objects using lower-dimensional building blocks.
