In an academic context, the word "foundation" can have different meanings depending on the field of study. However, in a general sense, a foundation is the underlying basis or support upon which something is built or developed.

# Foundational principles of Logic
In logic, the foundation refers to the fundamental principles or concepts that serve as the starting point for reasoning and argumentation. It involves establishing basic assumptions or axioms that are [[Essential|self-evident]] or [[Universality|universally accepted to be true]]. These foundational elements provide a solid ground upon which logical reasoning can be constructed and theories can be developed.

One common example of a foundation in logic is classical logic, which is based on principles such as the law of non-contradiction (a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time) and the principle of excluded middle (a statement is either true or false, with no middle ground). These principles form the foundation upon which logical reasoning and argumentation are built.
