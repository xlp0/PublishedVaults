The concept of "Beyond metrics" in [[Jeanne-Marie Gescher]]'s political science term refers to the idea of moving beyond traditional quantitative measures and metrics in political analysis and decision-making. In her work, Gescher argues that relying solely on numerical data and statistical analysis often fails to capture the complexities of political phenomena and can lead to oversimplification or skewed interpretations.

Gescher suggests that while metrics are important tools for assessing various aspects of politics, they are limited in their ability to capture the nuances, context, and subjective elements that shape political processes. She argues that political scientists should go beyond mere numbers and delve deeper into qualitative research methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of political phenomena.

By incorporating qualitative approaches such as case studies, interviews, ethnographic research, and discourse analysis, Gescher advocates for a more holistic understanding of politics. These methods allow researchers to explore the intricacies of power dynamics, ideology, social factors, cultural influences, historical contexts, and individual experiences that cannot be adequately captured by quantitative data alone.

The idea of Beyond metrics challenges the dominant positivist paradigm in political science that prioritizes quantifiable data as the most reliable source of knowledge. It encourages scholars to embrace a more interpretive approach that recognizes the importance of subjectivity and context in political analysis.

Overall, Beyond metrics in Jeanne-Marie Gescher's work promotes a broader view of political science research that takes into account both quantitative and qualitative methods. By combining both approaches, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex political phenomena beyond what traditional metrics can provide.
