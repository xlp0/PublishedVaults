Tell me about what is Platonism, and what does Ludwig Wittenstein and Alan Turing played any roles in it.

Platonism is a philosophical doctrine that originates from the ideas and teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher, [[Plato]]. It encompasses various beliefs and concepts, but it is primarily centered on the notion that there exists a higher reality or realm of ideal forms beyond the physical world.

According to Plato, the physical world we perceive through our senses is merely a flawed reflection or imitation of these perfect and unchanging forms. These forms are considered to be eternal, universal, and abstract entities that represent the true essence or nature of things. For example, there is an ideal form of a chair that exists in the realm of forms, and all physical chairs are imperfect copies of this ideal form.

## Alan Turing and Ludwig Wittgenstein on Platonism

It was known that Alan Turing attended some lectures by Wittgenstein(), and they must have some direct interactions according to this link:[[@murphyWhenAlanTuring2022|Turing and Wittgenstein on Liar's Paradox]]. 

1. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]: Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher who had a significant impact on various fields, including philosophy of language and logic. Wittgenstein was clearly anÂ [anti-Platonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Platonism)., his ideas challenged certain aspects of traditional philosophy that were influenced by Platonism.

Wittgenstein's philosophy emphasized language as a tool for communication. He argued against the idea that words have fixed meanings representing universal concepts or essences (as proposed by Platonism). Instead, he believed that meaning is derived from how words are used within specific language games or contexts. This approach undermined certain foundational elements of Platonism's metaphysical claims.

2. [[Alan Turing]]: Alan Turing was an English mathematician, logician, and computer scientist who made groundbreaking contributions to various fields, including artificial intelligence and computer science.  Turing was opposed to ideas presented by Wittgenstein, his work on building a physical computer is one of the most direct supporting evidence of Platonism.

Mathematical Platonism suggests that mathematical objects (such as numbers or geometric shapes) exist independently in some abstract realm. Turing's concept of computability challenged this perspective by proposing that mathematical problems could be solved algorithmically through a universal computing machine (the Turing machine). This perspective shifted the focus from the abstract existence of mathematical objects to their computability and practical application, challenging some aspects of Platonism.

In summary, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alan Turing did not play direct roles in Platonism or engage with it as central themes in their work. However, their ideas and perspectives had implications that challenged certain aspects of Platonistic beliefs in philosophy, language, logic, and mathematics.
