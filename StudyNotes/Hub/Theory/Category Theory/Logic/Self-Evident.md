# Self-Evidence and Essence

Self-evidence and [[Essential|essence]] are both philosophical concepts that pertain to the nature of knowledge and existence. However, they have distinct differences.

1. Self-evidence:
- Self-evidence refers to a proposition or statement that is immediately known to be true without requiring any further evidence or justification.
- It is a quality of certain beliefs or truths that are intuitively clear and evident to the mind.
- Self-evident truths are seen as axiomatic and do not require any external validation or argumentation.
- Examples of self-evident truths include "2+2=4" or "All bachelors are unmarried."

2. Essence:
- Essence refers to the fundamental nature or inherent characteristics that define something's [[identity]], being, or existence.
- It represents the core attributes or qualities without which something would cease to be what it is.
- Essence is often associated with the idea of essentialism, which posits that things have an unchanging essence that determines their nature and behavior.
- For example, according to essentialism, human beings have an essential nature that encompasses certain traits like rationality or consciousness.

Similarities:
1. Both self-evidence and essence involve an understanding of fundamental truths or realities.
2. They both deal with concepts related to knowledge and existence.
3. Both self-evidence and essence can be seen as foundational principles in various philosophical systems.

Differences:
1. Self-evidence relates more directly to the certainty or clarity of a proposition, while essence focuses on the underlying nature or qualities of something.
2. Self-evidence is concerned with immediate intuitive knowledge, whereas essence delves into deeper ontological aspects.

In summary, self-evidence pertains to propositions that are immediately apparent without requiring further justification, while essence refers to the inherent characteristics that define an entity's [[Identity|identity]].
