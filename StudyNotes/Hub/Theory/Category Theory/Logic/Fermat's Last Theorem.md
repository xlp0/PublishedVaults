Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous mathematical problem that was first proposed by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the 17th century. The theorem states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2.

Fermat himself claimed to have found a proof for this theorem but never wrote it down, leaving mathematicians puzzled for centuries. Many attempts were made to prove or disprove the theorem, but none were successful until 1994.

The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was finally achieved by the British mathematician [[Andrew Wiles]], after years of dedicated research and using advanced mathematical techniques. His proof involved elliptic curves, modular forms, and other highly complex mathematical concepts.

Wiles' proof is considered one of the greatest achievements in mathematics and has had significant implications in number theory and algebraic geometry. It has also highlighted the importance of rigorous proof techniques in mathematics.
