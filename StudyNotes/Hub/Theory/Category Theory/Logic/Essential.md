The word "essential" refers to something that is absolutely necessary or fundamental. It is often used to describe qualities or characteristics that are intrinsic and indispensable to the nature or identity of a particular object or concept.

In the context of universal properties of a class of objects, "essential" refers to those [[Universality|properties that are common and inherent to all members of that class]]. These essential properties define the core essence or nature of the objects within that class and distinguish them from other classes.

For example, in the class of mammals, having mammary glands to produce milk for nourishing their young can be considered an essential property. This property is shared by all mammals and is crucial for defining them as a distinct class.

# Self-evident and Being Essential
In terms of [[Self-Evident|self-evidence]], the essential nature or properties of an object can sometimes be intuitively understood without requiring external evidence or proof. They may be self-evident truths based on logical reasoning, observation, or common understanding.

For instance, it can be self-evident that honesty is an essential quality for trustworthiness. This understanding may arise from our innate sense of fairness and integrity, making it evident without any further explanation.

Overall, the term "essential" relates to the core and indispensable aspects of an object or concept, which can either be universally shared within a class or perceived as self-evident truths.
