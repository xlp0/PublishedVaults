In [[Category theory]], a natural transformation is a way to compare and relate two different functors. It is a morphism between functors that preserves the structure and relationships between the objects and morphisms in the categories involved.

Formally, given two categories C and D, and two functors F, G: C -> D, a natural transformation η: F -> G is defined as a family of morphisms η_c: F(c) -> G(c) for each object c in C, such that for every morphism f: c -> d in C, the following diagram commutes:

     F(c) ---η_c---> G(c)
      ||                ||
      || G(f)           || F(f)
      \/                \/
     F(d) ---η_d---> G(d)

where η_d = G(f) ∘ η_c ∘ F(f).

In other words, a natural transformation assigns to each object c in C an arrow η_c in D that relates the images of c under the functors F and G. It does so in a way that respects the composition of morphisms in both C and D.

Natural transformations are important in category theory because they capture the essence of functoriality and allow for comparisons between different functors. They provide a way to understand and analyze relationships between different mathematical structures across various categories.
