#composition #universality 

In this note, I want to emphasize that all workflows can be composed of a unifying workflow, based on the idea of logical [[Universality]]. If the universe was to be connected by one unifying theme, that would be something like [[Time]], or the idea of [[Data]] to be the glue to connect everything. This assumption also comes from the encouragement of the thesis by [[Pedro Domingos]], who proposes the existence of a single [[@domingosMasterAlgorithmHow2018|Master Algorithm]].
