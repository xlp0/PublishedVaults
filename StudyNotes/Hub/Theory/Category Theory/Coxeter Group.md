A Coxeter group, named after the mathematician [[H.S.M. Coxeter]], is a group that arises in the study of geometric symmetries. It is defined by a set of generators and relations, much like any other group. However, what sets Coxeter groups apart is their connection to reflection symmetries in Euclidean space.

In particular, a Coxeter group is generated by a set of reflections in hyperplanes. These reflections are typically represented as geometric transformations that fix one hyperplane while reflecting points across it. The relations among these generators dictate how they combine to form more complex transformations.

Coxeter groups have many interesting properties and applications across various branches of mathematics. For example, they can be used to study polyhedra and polytopes by understanding their symmetries. In fact, all regular polyhedra and regular polytopes can be described in terms of Coxeter groups.

Moreover, Coxeter groups have connections to other areas such as algebraic groups, Lie theory, and combinatorics. They provide a powerful framework for understanding the structure of abstract mathematical objects with symmetric properties.

The classification of Coxeter groups has been an important topic in mathematics. Some well-known examples include the symmetric group (which is a Coxeter group with reflections corresponding to transpositions), the Weyl groups associated with semisimple Lie algebras (which have applications in physics), and infinite families such as affine and hyperbolic Coxeter groups.

Overall, Coxeter groups play a fundamental role in studying symmetry and geometric structures in mathematics. They offer insights into diverse areas of research and have found applications not only in pure mathematics but also in physics, crystallography, computer science, and other fields.
