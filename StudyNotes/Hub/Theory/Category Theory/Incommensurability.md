The term "[[Incommensurability|incommensurability]]" has a significant relation with [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[paradigm shift]], and [[Magic|magic]]. Incommensurability, as coined by Kuhn, refers to the notion that scientific theories or paradigms are fundamentally incompatible and cannot be compared or measured using a common standard. This concept challenges the traditional view of science as a linear accumulation of knowledge and suggests that scientific progress involves radical shifts or revolutions rather than gradual developments.

Kuhn's work on incommensurability is closely tied to his theory of paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, scientific revolutions occur when anomalies or contradictions within a dominant paradigm become too significant to ignore. These anomalies lead to a crisis within the scientific community and eventually give rise to a new paradigm that offers a different perspective and framework for understanding the world. Incommensurability plays a crucial role in these paradigm shifts as it highlights the fundamental differences between old and new paradigms, making it difficult for proponents of different paradigms to communicate and evaluate each other's theories.

The concept of incommensurability also has interesting parallels with the idea of [[Magic|magic]]. Magic often operates outside the boundaries of conventional understanding and challenges established norms and explanations. Similarly, incommensurability challenges the existing scientific framework by suggesting that there may be fundamental gaps or limitations in our ability to compare or measure different theories or paradigms.

Furthermore, both magic and incommensurability involve a sense of mystery and wonder. In magic, illusions are created through tricks or techniques that defy our normal understanding of cause-and-effect relationships. Similarly, incommensurability presents an intellectual challenge by questioning our assumptions about how knowledge is acquired and how scientific progress occurs.

In summary, incommensurability's relation with Thomas Kuhn, paradigm shift, and magic lies in its disruptive nature - Anything in the past experience can not be considered [[Equivalence|equivalent]] to the phenomenon at hand. Something that challenges traditional views on scientific progress, requires the creation of alternative frameworks for understanding reality, and raising questions about the limits of our understanding.
