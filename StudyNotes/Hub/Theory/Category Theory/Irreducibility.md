In [[Representation theory|representation theory]], [[Irreducibility|irreducibility]] refers to the property of a representation that cannot be further decomposed into smaller, non-trivial subrepresentations. In other words, an irreducible representation is one that does not have any non-trivial invariant subspaces.

More formally, let V be a vector space over a field F and G be a group. A representation of G on V is a homomorphism ρ: G -> GL(V), where GL(V) denotes the general linear group of invertible linear transformations on V. The vector space V together with the group G and the homomorphism ρ form what is known as a group representation.

If V has no non-trivial invariant subspaces under the action of G (i.e., there are no proper subspaces W of V such that ρ(g)(w) ∈ W for all g ∈ G and w ∈ W), then the representation ρ is said to be irreducible.

Irreducible representations play a fundamental role in representation theory. They provide the building blocks for constructing more general representations by means of direct [[Add|sums]] and [[Tensor Product|tensor products]]. By decomposing a given representation into irreducible components, one gains valuable insight into its structure and properties.

Moreover, irreducible representations have many interesting properties. For example, they can be used to classify representations up to isomorphism and determine important features of the underlying group or algebraic structure. In some cases, irreducible representations may also correspond to certain physical observables or symmetries in applications related to quantum mechanics or particle physics.

Overall, studying irreducibility in representation theory helps us understand how groups act on vector spaces and provides powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating these actions in various mathematical contexts.
