While watching this video [[@qispeaksmusicLaoShiYiDingBuHuiJiaoNiDeShuXueHeYinLeDeLianXiQingXuLiDuYuYinLe2023|Cognitive Connection]] I realized that there is a strong inter-disciplinary connection between different human experiences. This is directly related to our strategy with [[EuMuse]].

## Cognition as a Function of Classification
As the instructor talks about his idea about this cognitive connection between Math and Music, it turns out that one could develop a curriculum to explicitly make these connections in a topological manner. He was clearly using a Venn diagram technique with 2x2 multiplication of distinctive possibilities. We can actually summarize his idea as if all cognitive processes are some kind of classification process. This is also related to the ability or cognitive powers in making minute, delicate differences between different classes of data points or expressions.
